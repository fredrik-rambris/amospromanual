    <h1>Multi-Tasking</h1>


    <p>
        AMOS Professional can be run at the same time as totally separate programs and utilities such as
        DPaint III. This allows the creation and testing of original AMOS Professional programs while
        drawing on the resources of your favourite audio, graphical and utility items.</p>

    <p>
        Provided that your system has at least one megabyte, multi-tasking is activated by pressing
        [Amiga]+[A] to flick between AMOS Professional and the CLI or Workbench environments.</p>

    <p>
        To make effective multi-tasking programs, most of the processing time should not be grabbed,
        leaving only a limited amount of processing power for other tasks, and the following command
        is provided to solve this problem.</p>

    <p>
        <i>instruction: force a multi-task wait vbl</i><br>
        <b>Multi Wait</b></p>

    <p>
        The MULTI WAIT instruction should be used in the main loop of an AMOS Professional
        program. It forces a multi-task WAIT VBL for situations such as waiting for a menu item to be
        selected.</p>

    <p>
        This command should not be used to achieve accurate screen synchronisation, as it has been
        specifically provided for multi-tasking and may skip several vertical blank periods, depending
        on the number of tasks being run simultaneously.</p>

    <p>
        The following simple commands are provided to allow complete control over multi-tasking
        facilities.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-amos-to-back">AMOS TO BACK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: hide AMOS Professional and reveal the Workbench</i><br>
        <b>Amos To Back</b></p>

    <p>
        This instruction allows other programs to be accessed, by bringing forward the Workbench
        display and hiding AMOS Professional from view.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-amos-to-front">AMOS TO FRONT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: hide the Workbench and reveal AMOS Professional</i><br>
        <b>Amos To Front</b></p>

    <p>
        Similarly, this instruction forces AMOS Professional back onto the display, leaving the
        Workbench environment hidden.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-amos-lock">AMOS LOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: disable [Amiga]+[A] toggle</i><br>
        <b>Amos Lock</b></p>

    <p>
        The AMOS LOCK command disables the facility to toggle between AMOS Professional and the
        Workbench by pressing [Amiga]+[A]. This can be used to prevent other users from discovering
        how your program was written!</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-amos-unlock">AMOS UNLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: re-activate toggle between AMOS Professional and Workbench</i><br>
        <b>Amos Unlock</b></p>

    <p>
        Use this instruction to restore the facility for flipping between AMOS Professional and the
        Workbench, via the [Amiga]+[A] keys.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-amos-here">AMOS HERE</h3>
    <p><i>function: report if AMOS Professional is currently at the front of the display</i><br>
        status=<b>Amos Here</b></p>

    <p>
        AMOS HERE is used to provide a simple report. A value of -1(True) is returned if AMOS
        Professional is currently displayed, otherwise zero (False) indicates that the Workbench is in
        view.</p>

<section id="01-communication-between-programs">
    <h2>Communication between programs</h2>
    <p>
        As well as multi-tasking between AMOS Professional and other programs, communication is
        allowed between different AMOS Professional programs previously installed in memory.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-prun">PRUN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: run a program from memory</i><br>
        <b>Prun</b> "program name"</p>

    <p>
        This command can be used either from Direct Mode or from within a program, and it is a
        combination of calling a procedure and running another program. It is also extremely powerful!
        When PRUN is called, it has the following effect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A search is made through a program list for the specified program to be run, such as
            "Program_Name.AMOS".
        </li>
        <li>If it isn't found, this program is loaded and then tested.</li>
        <li>If an error is encountered, an exit will be made to the original program from which PRUN was
            called.
        </li>
        <li>If everything is in order, all variables are initialised, but the display is left unchanged. All
            screens remain open, with any windows and zones remaining defined. Opened files will
            remain open for AmigaDOS, but will appear to be closed to the new program. The new
            program is free to re-open these files.
        </li>
        <li>Bobs and Sprites are erased as the Object Bank is changed, and any music will be stopped.
            Banks may be passed between programs, however, and this is explained in <a href="05-09-memory-banks.html">Chapter 5.9</a>.
        </li>
        <li>The new program will now be run.</li>
        <li>When the program is over, or if an error is encountered, an exit is made to the AMOS
            Professional program from which PRUN was called.
        </li>
        <li>All variable buffers are erased, all files are closed in the program that was called, and Objects
            and music will be halted. The screens will remain as they were.
        </li>
        <li>If the called program was not originally resident in memory but was loaded, it is now
            removed from memory.
        </li>
        <li>Control is returned to the original program, at the position immediately after the PRUN
            command.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>Here is an example of a boot menu, demonstrating a very simple version of this technique:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Do
 Screen Open 0,640,200,4,Hires
 Repeat
 Input "Please enter a program name to run: ";P$
 Exit If P$="",2
 Trap Prun P$
 If Errtrap : Print "Program not found!" : End If
Until Errtrap=0
Wait 50
  Loop
</code>

    <ul>
        <li>You may use PRUN to call and run as many programs as memory allows.</li>
        <li>If there is a SYSTEM instruction in a program called by PRUN, it will not return to the
            Workbench, but back to the previous program.
        </li>
        <li>PRUN will work with compiled programs in exactly the same way as outlined above, except
            there will be no ".AMOS" appended to the name of the program that is to be loaded and run.
        </li>
        <li>The COMMAND LINES reserved variable can be used to send parameters between programs.</li>
        <li>The BGRAB command can be used to grab banks from the original program to the program
            that has been called.
        </li>
        <li>If an error is encountered during testing or running, a value will be stored in the PARAM
            function, as follows: <0 if there is a test-time error, >0 if there is a run-time error and zero if
            no error is encountered at all.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you are not sure about the display before calling another program with PRUN, simply close all
        current screens. This will also free as much memory as possible. Similarly, if you are not sure
        about the display after running another program with PRUN, you should also close all of the
        screens, and then call the main screen initialisation of your original program again.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-prg-under">PRG UNDER</h3>
    <p><i>function: report the availability of a program "under" the current program</i><br>
        status=<b>Prg Under</b></p>

    <p>
        This function is used to report on the accessibility of an AMOS Professional program that is
        "under" the current program. One of three values can be returned:</p>

    <p>
        Zero indicates that the current program is running normally, under the control of the Editor.
        Remote editor commands and BGRAB <b>cannot</b> be used.</p>

    <p>
        A value of 1 indicates that the current program is the only program running, but it is <b>not</b> the
        program currently under the control of the Editor. This happens when an accessory program is
        run or a "program to menu" option is selected, and remote editor commands are allowed as well
        as the use of the BGRAB command.</p>

    <p>
        A value of -1 means that the program has been run via another program, using PRUN. In this
        case, memory banks can be grabbed, but remote editor commands <b>cannot</b> be sent.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-exec">EXEC</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: send a CLI command to a device</i><br>
        <b>Exec</b> "CLI Command","Output"</p>

    <p>
        The EXEC instruction executes the specified CLI command, via the named output. Output refers
        to the name of an AmigaDos device, and is held in inverted commas. If these are empty "", NIL:
        will be used, otherwise the name of the output device must end with a colon.</p>

    <p>
        "CUR:" specifies that the current CLI window is to be used. If this window does not exist,
        because AMOS Professional was booted from the Workbench, then the EXEC command cannot
        operate. If "CON:" is used, then a CLI window is opened under the Workbench screen, if
        possible. Any other Amiga device can be specified, as long as it is interactive, and it will be
        opened before the CLI command is sent, and closed again after the command has been sent,
        unless it is the current CLI window.</p>

    <p>
        For example, to execute an external program copied into the C: directory of AMOS Professional,
        and wait for its completion, this could be used:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Amos To Back : Rem Reveal the Workbench
Rem Now launch the program in a small CLI window
Exec "Program Name","CON:0/0/160/48/Program Name"
Amos To Front : <comment>Rem Return to AMOS Pro after the program</comment>
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-prg-state">PRG STATE</h3>
    <p><i>function: return the status of how the current program was originally run</i><br>
        status=<b>Prg State</b></p>

    <p>
        Finally, here is a useful function which gives a report on how the current program was
        originally run. PRG STATE can return one of three possible values, as follows:</p>

    <pre>
<b>Value    Meaning</b>
0       Program is run under the AMOS Professional Editor
1       Program is run under run-time only
-1      Program is compiled
</pre>
