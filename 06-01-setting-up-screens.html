    <h1>Setting up Screens</h1>

    <p>This Chapter explains how AMOS Professional screens are created and made ready to display
        the wonders of text, graphics and special effects.</p>

    <p>
        Think of your television set or monitor as a glass window, through which you can view
        whatever AMOS Professional displays on its own "screen". The screen used to show AMOS
        Professional images is <b>not</b> the same as your TV display, because an AMOS Professional screen
        can be changed in many different ways, while the glass window of the TV set remains firmly
        fixed!</p>

    <p>
        So far in this User Guide, everything has been displayed on a single AMOS Professional screen
        that appears in the glass window of your TV set. As an aid to understanding the theory of
        different screens, and to see the theory put into practice, make sure that you use the ready-made
        HELP programs as you read through this Chapter.</p>

<section id="01-the-amos-professional-screens">
    <h2>The AMOS Professional screens</h2>

    <p><b>The default screen</b><br>

        Whenever an AMOS Professional program is run, a screen area is automatically set up to display
        the results of that program. This is known as the "default" screen, and it forms the standard
        display area that is used for all normal drawing operations. The default screen is given the
        identity number zero. The individual dots on the screen that make up the image are known as
        "pixels", and screen zero is 320 pixels wide, 200 pixels high and it can display 16 different
        colours.</p>

    <p><b>Additional screens</b><br>

        Apart from the default screen, seven more screens can be set up and used for AMOS
        Professional programs, and each of these new screens is given an identity number from 1 to 7.
        When a new screen is set up, it has to be "opened", and when this is done, its individual width,
        height, number of colours and pixel size is also defined.</p>

    <p><b>Screen resolution</b><br>

        Although the default screen is 320 pixels wide, this "resolution" can be doubled to 640 pixels
        across the screen. When the screen is 320 pixels wide it is in low resolution, or "Lowres", for
        short. If this is changed to 640 pixels wide, the screen is in high resolution, known as "Hires".</p>

<section id="02-defining-a-screen">
    <h2>Defining a screen</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-open">SCREEN OPEN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: open a new screen</i><br>
        <b>Screen Open</b> number,width,height,colours,pixel mode</p>

    <p>To open a new screen give the SCREEN OPEN command, followed by these parameters:</p>

    <p>
        <b>Number</b> is the identification number of the new screen, ranging from 0 to 7. If a screen with this
        number already exists, it will be completely replaced by this new screen.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Width</b> sets up the numbest- of pixels that will make up the width of the new screen. There is no
        problem in opening a screen that is wider than the physical limit of the television or monitor
        display, and extra-wide screens can be manipulated by the SCREEN OFFSET command. The
        widest possible screen is 1024 pixels across, from zero to 1023.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Height</b> holds the number of pixels that make up the height of the screen. Like the width
        parameter, this can be larger than the visible screen height to a maximum of 1023 pixels, and
        scrolled into view. Screens with oversized widths and heights can be used with all of the normal
        screen techniques which are explained later.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Colours</b> sets the number of colours to be used for the new screen. The choice for this number is
        normally between 2,4,8,16 or 32. There are two special sorts of screens that can make use of 64
        colours (Extra Half Bright mode screens), and 4096 colours (Hold And Modify mode screens),
        and these modes are explained at the end of this Chapter.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Pixel mode</b> is a choice of the width of the pixel points on the screen. Lowres is the normal status,
        allowing 320 pixels to be displayed across the screen, at any one time. Hires halves the width of
        each pixel, and so allows 640 to be displayed.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-lowres">LOWRES</h3>
    <p><i>function: set screen mode to 320 pixels wide</i><br>
        <b>Screen Open</b> number,width,height,colours,<b>Lowres</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-hires">HIRES</h3>
    <p><i>function: set screen mode to 640 pixels wide</i><br>
        <b>Screen Open</b> number,width,height,colours,<b>Hires</b></p>

    <p>
        When the default screen is automatically opened, screen 0 is the equivalent to the following
        setting:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Screen Open 0,320,200,16,Lowres</code>

    <p>
        To open screen number 1 as an oversize high-resolution screen with eight colours, you would
        use something like this:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">Screen Open 1,600,400,8,Hires</code>

    <p>This routine opens all eight available screens and brings them into view:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">Curs Off : Cls 13: Paper 13
Print : Centre "Hello, I'm SCREEN 0"
For S=1 To 7
 Screen Open S,320,20,16,Lowres
 Curs Off : Cls S+2 : Paper S+2
 Centre "And I am SCREEN"+Str$(S)
 Screen Display S,,50+S*25,,8
Next S
</code>

    <p>
        Here is a table which lists the different screen options, along with an indication of the amount of
        memory a standard size screen will consume.</p>

    <h2>Controlling screens</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-close">SCREEN CLOSE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: erase a screen</i><br>
        <b>Screen Close</b> number</p>

    <p>
        Use the SCREEN CLOSE command to erase a screen and free the memory it was using for other
        programming needs. Simply specify the screen number to be deleted.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-default">DEFAULT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: re-set to the default screen</i><br>
        <b>Default</b></p>

    <p>
        The DEFAULT instruction closes all currently opened screens and restores the display back to
        the original default setting.</p>

    <p>
        <b>AUTO VIEW ON</b><br>
        <b>AUTO VIEW OFF</b><br>
        <i>instructions: toggle viewing mode on and off</i><br>
        <b>Auto View On</b><br>
        <b>Auto View Off</b></p>

    <p>
        When SCREEN OPEN is used to create a new screen, the screen is usually displayed at once.
        This may be inconvenient during the initialisation stages of a program, in which case the AUTO
        VIEW OFF command can be used to disable this automatic display system. Screens can then be
        updated at a convenient point, using the VIEW instruction. To re-activate the automatic screen
        updating system, use the AUTO VIEW ON command.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-view">VIEW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: display current screen setting</i><br>
        <b>View</b></p>

    <p>
        When the AUTO VIEW OFF instruction is engaged, VIEW can be used to display any changes
        that have been made to the current screen settings, and they will be displayed at the next
        vertical blank period following the VIEW command.</p>
</section>

<section id="04-moving-a-screen">
    <h2>Moving a screen</h2>

    <p>Once a screen has been opened, it can be positioned and moved anywhere on the television
        display. This means that screens can be made to bounce, slip, slide, flip over, sink out of sight
        and behave in all sorts of bizarre ways. This also means that screens can overlap or be displayed
        above one another, and so several different screen modes can be shown at once in separate areas
        of the display.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-display">SCREEN DISPLAY</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: position a screen</i><br>
        <b>Screen Display</b> number<br>
        <b>Screen Display</b> number,x,y, width,height</p>

    <p>To position a screen, the SCREEN DISPLAY command is used, followed by these parameters:</p>

    <p>
        <b>Number</b> refers to the number of the screen to be displayed, from 0 to 7. All or any of the other
        parameters can be omitted, but the relevant commas must be included.</p>

    <p>
        The x,y-coordinates are given as "hardware" coordinates, which refer to physical positions on
        the television screen, <b>not</b> the area used by AMOS Professional screens. These set the position
        from which your AMOS Professional screen will be displayed on the TV screen.</p>

    <p>
        X coordinates can range from 0 to 448, and they are automatically rounded <b>down</b> to the nearest
        16-pixel boundary. Only the positions from 112 to 432 are actually visible on the TV screen, so
        avoid using an x-coordinate below 112.</p>

    <p>
        Y coordinates can range between 0 and 312, but because every TV set displays a slightly
        different visible area, it is sensible to keep the range between 30 and 300. A small amount of
        experimenting will reveal what suits your own system.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Width</b> sets the width of the screen in pixels. If this is different from the original setting, only a
        part of the image will be shown, starting from the top left-hand corner of the screen. It will also
        be rounded down to the nearest 16 pixels.</p>

    <p><b>Height</b> is used to set the height of the screen in exactly the same way as the width.</p>

    <p>If any of the optional parameters are left out, the <b>default</b> settings will be applied automatically.</p>

    <p>
        For example, to display screen zero, keeping its original width and height, this line could be
        used:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Screen Display 0,112,40,,</code>

    <p>
        Only one screen at a time can be shown on each horizontal line of the display, but several
        screens can be placed on top of one another. If screens are placed next to each other, in other
        words if they are sewn together to make a continuous display, there is one line of pixels where
        the screens meet that becomes "dead". This effect can be seen by moving the mouse pointer
        between the Direct mode window and the Default Screen, where a line of "dead" pixels occurs.</p>

    <p>
        One way of getting over this dead zone is to create an extra-large screen that is bigger than the
        TV display, and then move the visible area around inside its boundaries. When using extra-large
        screens, the area to be viewed is set with the SCREEN OFFSET command.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-offset">SCREEN OFFSET</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: offset screen at hardware coordinates</i><br>
        <b>Screen Offset</b> number,x,y</p>

    <p>
        Look at the diagram below, where the area of the visible screen is shown as a sort of "port-hole"
        320 pixels wide by 200 pixels high, inside a larger AMOS Professional screen. Of course, the port-
        hole can be made smaller using the SCREEN DISPLAY command.</p>

    <img alt="Screen Offset"
         src="images/605screen.jpg">

    <p>
        The SCREEN OFFSET command is followed by the number of the screen to be displayed, then
        the x,y-coordinates of the "offset", which is the point where the top left-hand corner of the
        visible display is to start, measured from the top left-hand corner of the extra-large screen.</p>

    <p>
        The visible area can be Moved around the extra-large screen by changing the offset coordinates,
        and some very smooth scrolling effects are achieved. These can be used for background graphics
        in computer games, as well as more serious applications like route finders or star constellations.</p>
</section>

<section id="05-manipulating-screens">
    <h2>Manipulating screens</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-clone">SCREEN CLONE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: clone a screen</i><br>
        <b>Screen Clone</b> number</p>

    <p>
        To create an identical copy of the current screen, and assign this new "clone" with a new screen
        number, use the SCREEN CLONE command followed by the destination screen number. Here
        is an example of a multi-cloned screen:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Screen Open 0,320,20,4,Lowres
Flash Off
Screen Display 0,,70,,
For S=1 To 7
 Screen Clone S
 Screen Display S,,S*20+70,,
Next S
Print "Start typing";
Do
 AS=Inkey$
 If A$<>"" Then Print A$;
Loop
</code>

    <p>
        Screen cloning is an ideal technique for two-player computer games, with each player
        controlling half of the visible display area.</p>

    <p>
        The clone uses the same memory area as the original screen, and will be displayed at the same
        place as the original. Any of the usual screen operations can be used with the clone, such as
        SCREEN DISPLAY and SCREEN OFFSET. However, because there is only one copy of the
        original screen data in memory, it is impossible to use the SCREEN command with the cloned
        copy.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-dual-playfield">DUAL PLAYFIELD</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: combine two screens</i><br>
        <b>Dual Playfield</b> first screen,second screen</p>

    <p>
        The DUAL PLAYFIELD mode is the equivalent of mixing together two images from separate
        video cameras, and is achieved by displaying two screens simultaneously at the same x,y-
        coordinates. Each of the two screens can be manipulated completely independently from one
        other, and this can be exploited to produce very smooth parallax scrolling. Because the sizes of
        the two screens can be different, a smaller screen can be scrolled against a larger background
        screen, creating the parallax effect.</p>

    <p>
        The two components of this dual playfield are treated as any other AMOS Professional screen,
        and they can even be double buffered or animated with AMAL.</p>

    <p>
        To create a dual playfield screen, simply give the command, followed by the two numbers of the
        relevant screens, which have already been defined using SCREEN OPEN. Both screens must
        have the same resolution, and there are some restrictions on the number of colours allowed.
        Here is a table of the possibilities:</p>

    <pre>
<b>1st Screen    2nd Screen    Resolution of both screens</b>
2 colours     2 colours     Lowres or Hires
4 colours     2 colours     Lowres or Hires
4 colours     4 colours     Lowres or Hires
8 colours     4 colours     Lowres only
8 colours     8 colours     Lowres only
</pre>


    <p>
        The colours of these screens are taken from the palette of the <b>first</b> screen with colour zero being
        IF treated as transparent. The first screen makes use of colours zero to 7, while the second screen
        uses 8 to 15. When you are drawing to the second screen, AMOS Professional will automatically
        convert the colour index to the appropriate number before using it. This means that colours zero
        to 7 of the second screen's palette will use colours 8 to 15 of the first screen's palette, in
        ascending order.</p>

    <p>Always make the <b>first</b> screen the current screen when changing the colour settings.</p>

    <p>Remember that the automatic conversion process does not apply to assignment statements such
        as COLOUR or PALETTE.</p>

    <p>When using SCREEN OFFSET to position a dual playfield screen, always specify the first screen,
        and never set screen offsets for both dual playfield screens to zero.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-dual-priority">DUAL PRIORITY</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: reverse order of dual playfield screens</i><br>
        <b>Dual Priority</b> first screen, second screen</p>

    <p>
        Normally, the first screen of a dual playfield is displayed directly over the second screen. To
        reverse this order, so that the second screen appears in front of the first, use the DUAL
        PRIORITY command. Please note that this instruction only changes the order of display, and
        has no effect on the screen organisation at all, so the first screen in the parameter list is still used
        for all colour assignments, and with the SCREEN DISPLAY command.</p>
</section>

<section id="06-clearing-hiding-and-showing-screens">
    <h2>Clearing, hiding and showing screens</h2>

    Screens can be removed from view by permanently erasing them, or by hiding them away for
    later display.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-cls">CLS</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: clear current screen</i><br>
        <b>Cls</b><br>
        <b>Cls</b> colour number<br>
        <b>Cls</b> colour number,x1,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2</p>

    <p>
        The CLS command erases.all or part of the current screen. Used on its own, the contents of the
        current screen are deleted and replaced by the current paper colour. Any windows that may
        have been set up will also be cleared in this way.</p>

    <p>
        By specifying the index number of a particular colour after the CLS command, the clearing
        operation will be carried out using that colour.</p>

    <p>
        A rectangular part of the current screen can also be cleared, leaving the rest of the screen intact.
        This is achieved by adding the coordinates of the block to be filed with the specified colour, from
        the top left-hand corner, to the bottom right. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls: Circle 100,98,98: Cls 0,50,50 To 150,150</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-hide">SCREEN HIDE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: hide a screen</i><br>
        <b>Screen Hide</b><br>
        <b>Screen Hide</b> number</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-show">SCREEN SHOW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: show a screen</i><br>
        <b>Screen Show</b><br>
        <b>Screen Show</b> number</p>

    <p>
        Use the SCREEN HIDE command to remove the current screen from view. It can then be
        restored using a SCREEN SHOW instruction, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls : Print "I am the Current Screen" : Wait 100
Screen Hide : Wait Key
Screen Show
</code>

    <p>
        Any screen can be temporarily hidden, by including its index number after the SCREEN HIDE
        instruction. This screen is revealed with a similar request to SCREEN SHOW, followed by the
        relevant screen number.</p>
</section>

<section id="07-screen-priority">
    <h2>Screen priority</h2>

    <p>Because screens may be of different sizes, and because they can be displayed at various
        positioned on the TV by offsets and overlaps, and because there can be up to eight electronic
        screens queuing up one behind the other, a method is needed to bring any one of these screens
        to the front of the display.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-to-front">SCREEN TO FRONT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move screen to front of display</i><br>
        <b>Screen To Front</b><br>
        <b>Screen To Front</b> number</p>

    <p>
        Use SCREEN TO FRONT to move the selected screen to the front of the display queue. If the
        screen number is omitted after the command, then the current screen will be brought to the
        front.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen-to-back">SCREEN TO BACK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move screen to back of display</i><br>
        <b>Screen To Back</b><br>
        <b>Screen To Back</b> number</p>

    <p>
        This command is used to move a screen to the background of the display. If another screen is
        already there, it will be displayed in front of the chosen screen. Again, if the screen number is
        omitted after a SCREEN TO BACK command, the current screen will be relegated to the back of
        the display queue. Try this example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Centre "Hello again, Screen 0 here"
Wait 100
Screen Open 1,320,200,2,Lowres
Centre "Excuse me, make way for Screen 1"
Wait 100 : Screen To Front 0
Screen 0
Wait 100 : Screen To Back
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-screen">SCREEN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set current screen</i><br>
        <b>Screen</b> number</p>

    <p>
        This command allows <b>all</b> graphical and text operations to be directed to the selected screen
        number, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Screen Open 2,320,32,16,Lowres
Screen Display 2,,130,,
Screen 0
Plot 0,0: Draw To 320,200
</code>

    <p>
        If the chosen screen is outside of the current display area or is hidden, there will be no visible
        effect. However, any graphics will be drawn in memory, waiting to be displayed whenever this
        screen comes into view, or out of hiding after a Screen Show command.</p>

    <p><i>instruction: define standard palette</i><br>
        <b>Default Palette</b> $1,$2,$3 ... $32</p>

    <p>
        It is often necessary to open several screens using the same palette. To simplify this process, the
        DEFAULT PALETTE instruction is used to define a standard palette which will be used by <b>all</b>
        subsequent screens created by the SCREEN OPEN command. Colours are set using the $RGB
        values that are fully explained in the COLOUR section of <a href="06-04-graphics.html">Chapter 6.4</a>. Up to 32 colours may be
        defined, depending on the screen mode, and any colours that are not re-set must have their
        appropriate commas in place. Here is an example line for eight colour screens:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">Default Palette $000,$111,$A69,,,,,$FFF</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-get-palette">GET PALETTE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: copy palette from a screen</i><br>
        <b>Get Palette</b> number<br>
        <b>Get Palette</b> number,mask</p>

    <p>This command copies the colours from a specified screen, and loads them into the current
        screen. This is useful when data is being moved from one screen to another with a SCREEN
        COPY command, and the same colour settings need to be shared for both screens. An optional
        mask can be added after the screen number, allowing only selected colours to be loaded. This
        works in exactly the same way as a mask for a GET SPRITE PALETTE command, and is
        explained in <a href="07-01-hardware-sprites.html">Chapter 7.1</a>.</p>

    <h2>Screen functions</h2>

    <p>AMOS Professional provides a full range of screen functions, to monitor and exploit the current
        status of your screens.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-screen">SCREEN</h3>
    <p><i>function: give current screen number</i><br>
        screen number=<b>Screen</b></p>

    <p>
        SCREEN can be used as a function to return the number of the screen which is currently active.
        This screen is used for all drawing operations, but it is <b>not</b> necessarily visible.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-screen-height">SCREEN HEIGHT</h3>
    <p><i>function: give current screen height</i><br>
        height=<b>Screen Height</b><br>
        height=<b>Screen Height</b> number</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-screen-width">SCREEN WIDTH</h3>
    <p><i>function: give current screen width</i><br>
        height=<b>Screen Width</b><br>
        height=<b>Screen Width</b> (number)</p>

    <p>
        This pair of functions is used to return the height and the width of the current screen or a
        particular screen, if that screen number is specified. The dimensions of the current screen can be
        found like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Screen Height
Print Screen Width
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-screen-colour">SCREEN COLOUR</h3>
    <p><i>function: give maximum number of colours</i><br>
        number=<b>Screen Colour</b></p>

    <p>To find the maximum number of colours in the screen that is currently active, test the SCREEN
        COLOUR function now:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">Print Screen Colour</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-scin">SCIN</h3>
    <p><i>function: give screen number at hardware coordinates</i><br>
        number=<b>SCIN</b>(x,y)</p>

    <p>The SCIN function (short for SCreen In) is normally used with X MOUSE and Y MOUSE to
        check whether the mouse cursor has entered a particular screen. It returns the number of the
        screen which is underneath the selected <b>hardware</b> coordinates. If there is no screen there, a
        negative number will be returned.</p>

<section id="10-iff-screens">
    <h2>IFF screens</h2>

    <p>IFF stands for Interchangeable File Format, commonly used to pass data between computers.
        IFF pictures from Dpaint are a classic example. As well as importing your own IFF drawings,
        AMOS Professional allows you to make use of legally available, ready-made pictures in the
        public domain, for your own programs.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-load-iff">LOAD IFF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: load an IFF screen from disc</i><br>
        <b>Load Iff</b> "filename"<br>
        <b>Load Iff</b> "filename",screen number</p>

    <p>
        With the appropriate IFF picture files ready to be loaded on disc, this command is used to load
        the selected filename to the current screen. There is an optional screen number parameter,
        which will open that screen for the picture. If this numbered screen already exists, its contents
        will be erased and replaced by the IFF data.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-save-iff">SAVE IFF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: save an IFF screen to disc</i><br>
        <b>Save Iff</b> "filename"<br>
        <b>Save Iff</b> "filename"<br>
        <b>Save Iff</b> "filename",compression mode</p>

    <p>
        The SAVE IFF command saves the current screen as an IFF picture file with the selected
        filename onto disc. Certain data is automatically added to this IFF file, which stores the present
        screen settings, including any SCREEN DISPLAY, SCREEN OFFSET, SCREEN HIDE and
        SCREEN SHOW. This will be stored and recognised by AMOS Professional whenever this file is
        loaded again, so that the IFF screen will be displayed exactly as it was saved. Please note that
        this data will be ignored by other graphics packages, such as Dpaint 3, also that it is not possible
        to save double buffered or dual playfield screens with this command.</p>

    <p>
        An optional parameter can be added after the filename, which selects whether or not the IFF file
        is to be compacted before it is saved. A value of 1 specifies that the standard AMOS Professional
        compression system is to be used, whereas a zero saves the picture without any compression.</p>

<section id="11-extra-half-bright-mode">
    <h2>Extra Half Bright mode</h2>

    <p>The colour of every point on the screen is governed by a value held in one of the Amiga's colour
        registers. Each register can be loaded from a selection of 4096 different colours.</p>

    <p>
        There is no point in wasting the computer's memory with dozens of available colours, if only
        two of them are going to be employed for some simple text. On the other hand, there is no point
        being restricted to 16 or 32 colours if images need to be as realistic as possible. There are two
        special screen modes that change the number of colours for use, Extra Half Bright mode (EHB),
        and Hold And Modify mode (HAM).</p>

    <p>
        Extra Half Bright mode doubles the number of available colours to 64. This is achieved by
        creating two colours from each of the Amiga's 32 colour registers. Colour numbers 0 to 31 are
        loaded straight from one of the colour registers, as normal. But the EHB mode creates an extra
        set of colours alongside the originals, by looking at their values and dividing them in half. This
        makes the new set of colours exactly half as bright as the originals. The new set of colours uses
        index numbers from 32 to 63.</p>

    <p>
        Obviously, you can take full advantage of EHB by loading the 32 colour registers with the
        brightest colours available, so that pastel shades are generated automatically. Alternatively, if
        you needed to create specialised graphics, like an old-fashioned photograph for example, you
        might want to restrict the 32 colour registers to reds, greys and browns.</p>

    <p>
        Using EHB mode makes no difference at all to any other parts of your programming, and EHB
        screens are treated in exactly the same way as the default screen. It is also possible to create Bobs
        in this mode. Here is a simple example of EHB colours.</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Screen Close 0
Screen Open 2,320,167,64,Lowres : Flash Off
For C=1 To 32
 Ink C
 Bar 0,(C-1)*5 To 160,(2+C-1)*5
 Ink C+32
 Bar 160,(C-1)*5 To 319,(2+C-1)*5
Next C

<section id="12-hold-and-modify-mode">
    <h2>Hold And Modify mode</h2>

    <p>For an artist to carry around 4096 tubes of different coloured paint would be expensive and
        stupid, so an artist makes use of common colours, and mixes them together to create the exact
        shade needed. Computers use exactly the same process, allowing the programmer to hold on to
        an existing colour and modify it very slightly, time and time again. This is the theory behind the
        Amiga's Hold And Modify (HAM) mode.</p>

    HAM mode splits up colour values into four separate groups. Colours 0 to 15 are normal, and
    the others exploit the way that all colours are made up from basic Red, Green and Blue
    components.

    <p>
        It must be stated that HAM mode is difficult to use, but AMOS Professional is able to exploit its
        full potential. This is valuable for displaying digitised colour pictures, either grabbed from video
        images or created using special packages such as Dpaint 4. To open a HAM screen ready to
        display all 4096 available colours, the following line could be used:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Screen Open 0,320,256,4096,Lowres</code>

    <p>
        All text and graphics operations may be used directly with a HAM screen, and it can be
        manipulated by the normal SCREEN DISPLAY and SCREEN OFFSET commands.</p>

    <p>
        Do set the first point of each horizontal line to a colour numbered from 0 to 15, which will serve
        as the starting colour for all shades on the current line. To prevent unwanted fringe colours
        when SCREEN COPY is used, see that the screen's border zone also uses a colour from 0 to 15.
        This ensures that HAM screens are re-drawn at a new position using their original colours.</p>

    <p>
        Do not try to scroll a HAM screen horizontally, unless you wish to see fringes of spurious colour
        at the side of the picture. This problem does not occur with vertical scrolls.</p>

<section id="13-interlaced-screens">
    <h2>Interlaced screens</h2>

    <p>Interlaced mode is perfect for displaying pictures, but is not recommended for much else.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-laced">LACED</h3>
    <p><i>reserved variable: return a value in conjunction with screen resolution</i><br>
        <b>Screen Open</b> number,width,height,colours,<b>Laced</b>+resolution</p>

    LACED is a reserved variable which holds the value of 4. It is used in addition to either the Hires
    or Lowres parameters when opening a screen, like this:

<code class="prefix edit">Screen Open 0,320,200,16,Laced+Lowres</code>

    <p>
        Interlaced screens have <b>double</b> the number of vertical lines, which is excellent for graphic
        displays. Unfortunately they take twice as long to update, which is no good at all for fast-action
        games! Interlaced screens will only give flicker-free results if a "multi-sync" monitor is being
        used. Also certain TV sets and monitors do not take kindly to excessive switching between
        interlaced and normal screens.</p>

    <p>
        All of the usual operations may be used with interlaced screens, such as SCREEN DISPLAY,
        SCREEN OFFSET, and so on, but for technical reasons interlacing is not allowed during copper
        list calculations. As soon as the last interlaced screen has been closed, the entire display returns
        to normal mode.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-screen-mode">SCREEN MODE</h3>
    <p><i>function: return screen mode</i><br>
        value=<b>Screen Mode</b></p>

    <p>
        This simple function is used to report the mode of the current screen. If the screen is LACED,
        4 or $8004 will be returned. If the screen is LOWRES, a value of $0 is given.
        For a HIRES screen, $8000 will be returned.</p>
