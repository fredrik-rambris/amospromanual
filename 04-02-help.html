<h1>Help</h1>

<br>


<P>This Chapter explains how AMOS Professional provides detailed on-screen help, co
every aspect of the system and your programming.</P>

<P>
The User Guide is provided to explain all the features of AMOS Professional in detail, 
and to act as your instructor, but a large book can never offer the instant help made possible by a 
computer program. AMOS Professional has been designed to be as friendly as possible, and it 
harnesses the power of the Amiga itself to provide you with interactive Help in your 
programming.</P>
</section>

<section id="01-calling-for-help">
<h2>Calling for Help</h2>

<P>Help is available at the touch of a button, whenever you are in edit mode. Simply press
the [Help] key, it's as obvious as that! Alternatively, click on the [H] icon at the top of 
the Edit Screen.</P>

<P>
An additional list of Help options is also revealed by holding down the right mouse 
button, dragging the mouse pointer to the [Help] menu, and selecting one of the pre-set headings. 
To start with, select the [Main Menu] option from the [Help], menu, or simply press the 
[Help] key, or click on the [H] icon. In all cases, the Main Menu will appear in a special Help Window.</P>
</section>

<section id="02-the-help-window">
<h2>The Help Window</h2>

<P>Whenever [Help] is summoned, the AMOS Professional Help Window is flicked onto the
screen. If it obscures your listing, it can be repositioned by dragging the title bar up and down. 
All options are selected via the left mouse buttons. At the left-hand side of the title bar, 
there is a [Close] button, to return you to the Edit screen.</P>

<P>On the right-hand side of the bar there are three simple options:</p>

<p><b>[Prev Page]</b><BR>
Click on this to reveal the previous page that was called during the helping process.</P>

<P><b>[Main Menu]</b><BR>
This option summons the Help system's Main Menu on screen.</p>

<p><b>[Print]</b><BR>
	
When this option is selected, you will be requested to check that your printer is ready to 
receive the words of wisdom offered by the Help system. Simply click on [Ok] to obtain a printed 
copy of the current Help text.</P>

<P>
On the right-hand side of the Help window there is a vertical slider bar and a pair of 
up/down arrows, enabling you to scroll through the Help text.</p>

<h3>The Main Menu</h3>
<p>Using the AMOS Professional help system is completely straightforward, extremely simple,
and incredibly powerful!</P>

<p>The Main Menu presents a series of sub menus, as follows:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
	    <b>Main Menu</b>
   Using Help           Audio
   Editor               AMOS Interface
   Direct Mode          Input/Output
   Syntax conventions   AmigaDos
   Basics of AMOS       Debugging
   Screen control       Machine code
   Object control       Tables
            Latest News
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Please note that this Menu may not appear exactly as in this User Guide listing, because 
we may have added more information since going to print.</p>

<p>
If you need assistance with any of these topics, simply select one.</p>

<p>
Summoning direct Help during programming is explained later. Please select the [Basics of
AMOS] option now, to reveal a more detailed list of Help topics.</p>

<h3>Sub-menus</h3>

<p>As soon as an item is triggered by the left mouse button from the Help system Main Menu, a
selection of related topics is revealed. Any of these new headings can now be selected as 
before. In the case of the [Basics of AMOS] option that you have just selected, they range from 
[The Bare Bones] to [Memory Banks]. Please select the [Text] option that is on your screen now.</p>

<p>
As you have probably guessed, all of the AMOS Professional features relating to [Text] are 
now displayed on screen. Please select [Print] for a demonstration of instant Help. 
Not only will this command be explained in the form of text on your screen, you will also be 
invited to click on the highlighted instruction [Print] and be treated to an instant demonstration program!</p>

<p>
There is so much electronic Help on offer, that this User Guide may seem redundant! Please
keep reading anyway.</p>

<section id="03-summoning-help-directly">
<h2>Summoning Help directly</h2>

<p>In the early stages of AMOS Professional programming, before you become completely
familiar with all the features, it is all too easy to loose track of the precise format of every 
command. It can be very frustrating to consult this User Guide in the middle of programming, and even
using the various Help menus may break your concentration. To make programming as painless
as possible, Help can be summoned directly from your program listings!</p>

<p>
To receive instant help on any command directly from the Editor, either type in the 
instruction that you are not sure about, or go to an instruction that is already in your program, and 
position the program cursor over the <b>first</b> letter of that word. Now press the [Help] key or click 
on the [H] icon for instant assistance.</p>
</section>

<section id="04-additional-help">
<h2>Additional help</h2>

<p>There is a complete range of additional help features available to the AMOS
Professional programmer. Here is a brief introduction to each of them.</P>

<h3>Error Messages</h3>

<p>If AMOS Professional encounters any problems with your listings, a wide range of
helpful messages is available to pinpoint the error. These error messages appear in the 
Information Line Hear the top of the Edit Screen, and they fall into three main categories. Editing 
messages can appear while you are in the process of editing your programs, such as "Line too long". 
Program messages like "FOR without matching NEXT" may be displayed when you [Test] your work,
a lid the program cursor will try to pinpoint where the problem is lurking in your 
listings. Run-time messages come complete with their own number code, and they spotlight errors
encountered while your program is up and running.</P>

<P>
A full list of these error messages can be found in Chapter 12.3, along with an 
explanation of what they mean, and how to deal with the problem. Errors can usually be "trapped", and
<a href="12-02-error-handling.html">Chapter 12.2</a> is devoted to this sport.</P>

<h3>The AMOS Professional Monitor</h3>

<p>This feature is used to get inside your programs, examine any AMOS professional routine,
discover exactly what is happening, why it is happening and make a full report on screen. 
The Monitor not only offers help, it provides an instant diagnosis! All is explained in 
<a href="12-01-the-monitor.html">Chapter 12.1</a>.</P>

<h3>Continuing Support</h3>

<p>It has always been our policy to provide as much help and support to AMOS users as
possible,and AMOS Professional programmers are offered this assistance too. Future Support is dealt
with in <a href="...14/1468.html">Appendix I</a>, at the back of this User Guide, and you may well want to join the 
network of world-wide clubs and groups offering a huge range of help and support to AMOS
Professional programmers. The services of the AMOS PD Library are detailed in <a href="14/1467.html">Appendix H</a>.</P>
