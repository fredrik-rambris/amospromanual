<h1>Advanced Control Panels</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>A</b>rray<b>S</b>ize<br>
<i>Interface function: return the size of an array</i><br>
size=address <b>AS</b></p>

<p>
The ArraySize function is used to return the number of elements in an AMOS Professional array,
stored at the specified address. The address is the location of the array in memory which has
been loaded from the ARRAY function.</p>

<p><b>Displaying items on the screen</b><br>

After an item array has been entered into the Interface, it can be displayed on the screen using
the powerful ActiveList command.</p>

<p>
<b>A</b>ctive<b>L</b>ist<br>
<i>Interface instruction: display an active list window</i><br>
<b>AL</b> zone number,x,y,width,height,address,index,flag,paper,pen;[changes]</p>

<p>
This command displays an active window for an AMOS Professional string array. Each string
can be individually selected with the mouse, and returned to the main program by the
RDIALOG$ function. An ActiveList command can be linked to a set of slider bars or an edit
zone, so that the bars move the list up and down through the array, and the edit zone changes
the value that has been selected on screen.</p>

<p>The parameters for this instruction must be given in the following order:</p>

<p>
The zone number to be allocated to the selector, followed by the x,y-coordinates to set the
position of the selection box on screen. Because a normal window is used for this display, the
location of the x-coordinate will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 16. If the coordinate
base has been set to a new value with a BAse instruction, this will be added to the x-coordinate
before it is rounded down, so the final screen coordinate will always be an exact multiple of 16.</p>

<p>The width and height of the window are specified next, in the number of characters required.</p>

<p>
These parameters are followed by the address of the string array to be displayed in the selector
box, and this array must have been previously defined in the program. The address of the array
can now be grabbed with the ARRAY function from the AMOS Professional main program, and
loaded into an appropriate Interface variable with VDIALOG. It can then be entered directly
into the AList command. This system is explained in detail below.</p>

<p>
The next parameter is the index number of the first item to be displayed in the selector box. If
this number goes past the end of the array, the selector will be filled with blank lines.</p>

<p>The flag parameter is a bit-map that is used to trigger a range of useful features, as follows:</p>

<p>
Bit 0 If this is set to one, each string will be preceded by a number representing its position in the
array. The count normally starts from zero, but this can be changed as explained next.</p>
