<h1>Advanced Control Panels</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>DIALOG FREEZE</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop dialogue channel input</i><br>
<b>Dialog Freeze</b> [channel number]</p>

<p>
This command is used to freeze all input from one or more active dialogue channels. The
number of a single dialogue routine that is to be suspended is specified in square brackets. If this
number is omitted all current channels will be frozen.</p>

<p>
<b>DIALOG UNFREEZE</b><br>
<i>instruction: re-activate a frozen dialogue channel</i><br>
<b>Dialog Unfreeze</b> [channel number]</p>

<p>
Use this instruction to re-activate one or more dialogue channels from the point at which they
were frozen.</p>

<p>
<b>DIALOG CLR</b><br>
<i>instruction: clear a dialogue box</i><br>
<b>Dialog Clr</b> channel number</p>

<p>
The DIALOG CLR instruction erases all zones and shuts down the dialogue box completely,
leaving the specified channel open. The Interface program can now be re-run from the
beginning, using a further call to the DIALOG RUN command.
As always, if the background area has been saved using the SA option, it will be restored to its
original position.</p>

<p><b>HyperText</b><br>

The impressive interactive Help system is one of the most user-friendly aspects of the AMOS
Professional system, allowing detailed information to be called up using single mouse key-
presses from the Editor. More impressive than this is the fact that the Help system was entirely
written in AMOS Professional, and it is a typical example of the Interface in action!</p>

<p>
The final part of this Chapter explains how similar systems can be created using the HyperText
feature.</p>

<p>
<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext<br>
<i>Interface instruction: open an interactive text window</i><br>
<b>HT</b> zone number,x,y,width,height,address,line number,buffer,paper,pen;[changes]</p>

<p>
The HyperText command opens a simple window on a piece of text held in memory. This text
can include optional words or phrases that may be selected directly by the user. Each option
returns a specific value to the main program, which can then be used to jump to some
additional text, or call up an appropriate routine from the main program.</p>

<p>
The zone number is given as usual, followed by x,y-coordinates. The x-coordinate will be
rounded down to the nearest multiple of 16.</p>
