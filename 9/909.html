<h1>AMOS Interface</h1>

<br>

<p>
The delay parameter holds the interval time for the dialogue to remain on screen, specified in
50th of a second. If this value is greater than zero, the box will automatically exit after the
chosen period has elapsed, with no n ed for any user input. On the other hand, a value of zero
will wait patiently for a user response, or until the conditions specified in the flag values have
been met.</p>

<p>
The flag parameter is a simple bitmap, with a value of 1 in the relevant position activating the
feature, and a zero disabling it. Here are the settings:</p>

<pre>
Bit 0 clears the keyboard buffer before running. This is similar to a CLEAR KEY command.
Bit 1 ignores any accidental mouse key presses before the dialogue box is drawn.
Bit 2 exits whenever a key is pressed from the keyboard.
Bit 3 quits when the user clicks on one of the mouse keys.
</pre>

<p>Here are some example settings:</p>

<pre>
X> RUn 500,%1111; display box for five seconds or until mouse click or key press
   RUn 0,0; wait for quit button explained later
</pre>

<p>
You can now display a crude requester on the screen, by changing the last working example as
follows:</p>

<pre>
E> A$=A$+"BA 50,50; set the coordinate base"
   A$=A$+"SI 160,60; SA 1; save area under dialogue box"
   A$=A$+"IN 0,0,0; GB 5,5,155,56; IN 5,0,0; GB 0,0,150,50; draw a fancy box"
   A$=A$+"PO 5,10,'AMOS Professional',2,4; PR 45,20,'Basic',4; print messages"
   A$=A$+"RU 0,%0110; wait for either a mouse click or a key press"
   A$=A$+"EXit;"
   D=Dialog Box(A$)
</pre>

<p>
Requesters serve a useful purpose, but real control panels need to employ buttons, icons and
slider bars. The AMOS Professional Interface makes this very easy, and offers a large selection of
options.</p>

<p>
The last part of this Chapter deals with simple button commands Advanced control panels will
be explained in <a href="925.html">Chapter 9.3</a>. All these commands are used to display an object on the screen
which is automatically assigned its own zone, and can then be manipulated in a variety of ways.</p>

<p><b>Interface buttons</b></p>

<p><b>BU</b>tton<br>
<i>Interface instruction: define an Interface button</i><br>
<b>BU</b> number,x,y,width,height,setting,minimum,maximum;[][]</p>

<p>
The BUtton command defines a simple Interface button, which can then be selected directly
using the mouse. This button system is very flexible, and can be used to generate dozens of
different button types in a few simple lines of code.</p>
