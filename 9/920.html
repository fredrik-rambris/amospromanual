<h1>Interface Language</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>V</b>ert<b>T</b>ext<br>
<i>Interface instruction: display vertical text</i><br>
<b>VT</b> x,y,'text',colour</p>

<p>
The VertText command is used to display a column of vertical text using the specified colour
index number, starting at your chosen coordinates.</p>

<p><b>Labels and Tests</b><br>

The AMOS Professional Interface also supports a number of program control instructions,
allowing simple tests to be performed and jumps to be made to various routines. These controls
make it easy to create complex multi-level user interfaces.</p>

<p>
<b>LA</b>bel<br>
<i>Interface instruction: create a simple label</i><br>
<b>LA</b> label;</p>

<p>
The LAbel command is used to define a marker label in an Interface program. This can them be
employed as the target destination for a JumP or JumpSub command, which are the Interface's
equivalents to the familiar GOTO and GOSUB operations in normal AMOS Professional
programs. It can also be used as an entry point for the DIALOG RUN instruction.</p>

<p>Several complete dialogue boxes can be installed into the same definition string, if required.</p>

<p>
Unlike conventional AMOS Professional programs which recognise any characters for labels,
Interface labels are referred to by <b>numbers</b> only, ranging from zero up to 65535. If a newly
defined label already exists, an error message will be generated. Interface labels are defined in
the following manner:</p>

<pre>
X> LA 10; set up label number 10
</pre>

<p>
<b>J</b>m<b>P</b><br>
<i>Interface instruction: jump to an Interface program label</i><br>
<b>JP</b> label;</p>

<p>
The JumP command transfers control to the Interface instructions that commence with the
selected label number. This label must be defined elsewhere in the Interface program. The JumP
instruction <b>cannot</b> be used inside any of the routines held in square brackets of a BUtton
command. It is used with the single parameter of the target label, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> JumP 10;
</pre>

<p>
Interface labels are also used to mark the start of various subroutines, which are entered and left
as explained next.</p>
