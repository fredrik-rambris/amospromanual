<h1>Interface Language</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Lines and Outlines</b></p>

<p>
<b>S</b>et<b>L</b>ine<br>
<i>Interface instruction: set the style of a line</i><br>
<b>SL</b> pattern;</p>

<p>
This is identical to the SET LINE command, and is used to design the style of all future line
drawing. The pattern for the line style is set by the combination of "dots and dashes" in binary
format. For example, this example would set a line style of equal solid and blank components:</p>

<pre>
X> SLine %1111000011110000;
</pre>

<p>
<b>G</b>raphic<b>L</b>ine<br>
<i>Interface instruction: draw a line on the screen</i><br>
<b>GL</b> x1,y1,x2,y2;</p>

<p>
This command draws a graphical line from coordinates x1,y1 to x2,y2, like the normal DRAW
command. As usual with Interface commands, the starting coordinates are measured from the
BAse position. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> GLine 0,0,100,100
</pre>

<p>
<b>G</b>raphic<b>E</b>llipse<br>
<i>Interface instruction: draw an ellipse or circle</i><br>
<b>GE</b> x,y,radius1,radius2;</p>

<p>
This simple Interface command is used to draw hollow ellipses or circles. The centre of the
figure is set by coordinates x,y relative to the BAse location, and then the height and width of
the figure are set by specifying the length of the appropriate radii in pixels. To draw a circle,
simply specify the same value for both radii.</p>

<p><b>Displaying text</b><br>

Once the surroundings of the requester have been generated, the following commands will be
needed to display text in these dialogue boxes. The PRint command is examined in <a href="../9/901.html">Chapter 9.1</a>,
here are some more instructions to affect the way text is displayed.</p>

<p>
<b>P</b>rint<b>O</b>utline<br>
<i>Interface instruction: print hollow text with outline</i><br>
<b>PO</b> x,y,'text',outline colour,text colour;</p>

<p>
The PrintOutine command is used 'to call up outlined or stencilled text. This is achieved by
pasting the same text at slightly different positions, and is most effective with larger typefaces.
The parameters are self-explanatory, and consist of the starting coordinates for the text on
screen, the string of text enclosed in single quotation marks and the index numbers of the
outline and text colours.</p>
