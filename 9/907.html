<h1>AMOS Interface</h1>

<br>

<p>
Please note that if the Interface program is to wait for user input, a RunUntil command must be
included before the final EXit, otherwise the dialogue box will jump directly to the main AMOS
Professional program after the last Interface program instruction. RunUntil is explained in detail
below.</p>

<p>
The DIALOG BOX facility is only intended for simple requesters. To control the dialogue
directly from an AMOS Professional program, the DIALOG OPEN and DIALOG RUN
commands must be used instead. These are fully explained at the beginning of <a href="925.html">Chapter 9.3</a>,
which is devoted to advanced control panels.</p>

<p><b>Creating a simple requester</b><br>

If a large requester with a  lot of graphics is to be generated, it can be very difficult to keep track
of all of the coordinates. You can simplify things enormously by entering all of the coordinates
relative to the top left-hand corner of the requester box.</p>

<p><b>BA</b>se<br>
<i>Interface instruction: set coordinate base for dialogue box</i><br>
<b>BA</b> x,y;</p>

<p>
The BAse command sets the reference point for <b>all</b> future coordinate calculations, and is used by
simply setting the screen coordinates of the new origin. The default coordinate values are 0,0.</p>

<p>
If this command is called more than once, the new BAse setting will replace the previous one.
This coordinate reference point can also be set using the x,y parameters with the DIALOG BOX
command, as explained earlier. Here is a working example:</p>

<pre>
E> A$=A$+"BAse 50,50; set the coordinate base"
   A$=A$+"INk 5,0,0; Graphic Box 0,0,150,50; draw a filled bar in ink five"
   A$=A$+"PrintOutline 5,10,'AMOS Professional',2,4; print message in outline text"
   A$=A$+"PRint 45,20,'Basic',4; display message in normal text"
   A$=A$+"EXit; leave the interface program"
   D=Dialog Box(A$) : Wait Key
</pre>

<p><b>Saving the background graphics</b><br>

The simple drawing operations used in these examples would destroy any existing graphics on
the screen. But AMOS Professional dialogue boxes should wink into place over an existing
display, and then return the screen to its original state after use. The Interface includes
commands that do exactly that!</p>

<p><b>SI</b>ze<br>
<i>Interface instruction: define the size of graphics to be saved</i><br>
<b>SI</b> width,height;</p>

<p>
The SIze command sets the size of the dialogue box on the screen, and prepares the Interface
system to save the background graphics. The location of this screen area is set by giving the
number of pixels for the width of the zone, followed by the number of pixels for its height,
measured relative to the reference point already set by the BAse command.</p>
