<h1>Advanced Control Panels</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>VDIALOG</b><br>
<i>function: assign or read an Interface string</i><br>
<b>Vdialog</b>(channel number,variable number)=value<br>
value=<b>Vdialog</b>(channel number,variable number)</p>

<p>
This function can be used to either read or change the variables in any active Interface program.
The active channel number is selected, followed by the number of the variable you are
interested in. The value refers to the new integer value that has been selected for this variable.</p>

<p>
<b>VDIALOG$</b><br>
<i>function: assign or read an Interface value</i><br>
<b>Vdialog$</b>(channel number,variable number)=string$<br>
string$=<b>Vdialog$</b>(channel number,variable number)</p>

<p>
The VDIALOG$ function is exactly the same as the previous function, except that it works with
strings rather than numbers.</p>

<p>
Specify the channel number and the variable number, and then string$ holds a new AMOS
Professional string to be stored in the Interface variable array.</p>

<p><b>Advanced Control Panels</b><br>

There now follows a detailed examination of some of the additional zone commands which
make the AMOS Professional Interface so special!</p>

<p><b>Editing zones</b><br>

The AMOS Professional Interface allows for both text and numbers to be input into screen zones.</p>

<p>
<b>ED</b>it<br>
<i>Interface instruction: create a text edit zone</i><br>
<b>ED</b> zone number,x,y,width,max,'string',paper,pen;</p>

<p>
The EDit instruction opens a zone for text input on the screen. This zone can be selected with
the mouse, and then a string of characters may be typed in using all the normal line-editing
functions. The text cursor may also be positioned directly, by clicking the mouse pointer on the
required new position.</p>

<p>
The EDit parameters begin with the zone number, from 1 upwards. The x,y coordinates set the
position of the text input line relative to the coordinate base, and will be added to the BAse
setting to give the actual position of the line. If the resulting x-coordinate is not an exact multiple
of 16, it will be rounded <b>down</b> to the nearest 16 pixels.</p>

<p>
The width parameter sets the width of the text edit window, and is specified in the number of
characters to be accommodated, rounded <b>up</b> to the nearest even number. Next, the maximum
length of the text string must be given in characters, and an area of this size will be reserved in
the channel buffer.</p>
