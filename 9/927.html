<h1>Advanced Control Panels</h1>

<br>

<p>
Interface programs are terminated and removed from memory immediately. If the Interface
programs contain an SA command, the original background areas will be neatly pasted back
onto the display.</p>

<p>
Any active channel can be shut down with this command, by specifying a channel number. If
the channel number is omitted, <b>all</b> of the current Interface channels will be de-activated. Please
see the DIALOG FREEZE Command below, for something a little less drastic!</p>

<p>
<b>EDIALOG</b><br>
<i>function: find an error in an Interface program</i><br>
position=<b>Edialog</b></p>

<p>
Whenever an error occurs in an Interface program, its position can be found with a quick call to
the EDIALOG function. The relevant section of the Interface string will be displayed on screen,
enabling you to discover what has gone wrong. In practice, the most common mistakes are
caused by missing or wrongly-used semi-colon characters!</p>

<p>Here is a small error handler that may be useful if included in your own programs:</p>

<pre>
X> On ErrOr Goto TRAP: Rem Add this line before a DIALOG OPEN command
   ...: Rem The rest of your program goes here
   TRAP: Print Mid$(DB$,Edialog,80) : Wait Key : End : Rem Error handler
</pre>

<b>Testing an active zone</b></p>

<p>
DIALOG
<i>function: return status of an open dialogue box</i><br>
button=<b>Dialog</b>(channel number)</p>

<p>
This function provides a simple method of testing whether or not an option from a control panel
has been selected. Simply specify the number of the open channel that is to be tested.</p>

<p>
After this function has been performed, one of the following values for the tested button will be
returned:</p>

<pre>
<0 A negative value means that the current channel is inactive, either because it has not been
   assigned to a dialogue box, or because the user has left the box via an exit button.
=0 A value of zero indicates that there has been no user-input since the previous test.
>0 If a positive value is returned, it indicates the number of the last button that was selected by
   the user. In the case of edit zones, a value will only be returned when the [Return] key is
   pressed.
</pre>

<p>
Once the value of the contents held by the DIALOG function has been checked, it will be re-set
to zero.</p>
