<h1>Interface Language</h1>

<br>

<p>
All coordinates are measured from the start location of the dialogue box, which can be set by the
Interface instruction BAse, or the AMOS Professional command DIALOG BOX. The default
position is the top left-hand corner of the screen.</p>

<p>
<b>IN</b>k<br>
<i>Interface instruction: set current drawing colours</i><br>
<b>IN</b> pen,background,outline;</p>

<p>
The colours for boxes and bars and all future drawing operations are set by the INk command.
The three parameters are as follows:</p>

<p>The pen parameter is set by the colour index number to be used for drawing all future items.</p>

<p>
The background colour is then chosen for filling bars and for the paper colour on which text is to
be printed. This option is usually ignored, because the background is completely transparent,
but it may be activated using a SetWriting mode, which is explained later.</p>

<p>
The third parameter to be set is for the outline colour of a bar. This is only relevant if the outline
mode has been switched on, using a previous SetPattern instruction, also explained later.</p>

<p>
If one of these settings is to be left unchanged, simply enter a negative value for the relevant
colour number. As you may expect, a wide range of fill patterns can also be used.</p>

<p>
<b>S</b>et<b>P</b>attern<br>
<i>Interface instruction: set the fill pattern for dialogue box</i><br>
<b>SP</b> pattern number,outline mode;</p>

<p>
The Interface SetPattern command is a combination of the normal SET PATTERN and SET
PAINT instructions, and it is used to set the fill pattern and toggle the outline mode of all
subsequent GraphicBox commands.</p>

<p>
The pattern for all future drawing operations is an index number from zero to 34. The outline
mode can be set to zero to turn it off completely, or to 1 to activate the feature. If the setting is
activated, bars will be automatically enclosed by a hollow box in the current outline colour.</p>

<p>To generate a hollow box in its own right, the next command is used.</p>

<p>
<b>G</b>raphic<b>S</b>quare<br>
<i>Interface instruction: draw a hollow rectangle</i><br>
<b>GS</b> x1 ,y1 ,x2,y2;</p>

<p>
This is the equivalent to the normal BOX command, and it is used to draw a hollow rectangle,
determined by the coordinates of the top left and bottom right-hand corners.</p>
