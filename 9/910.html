<h1>AMOS Interface</h1>

<br>

<p>
These buttons can be read in several ways. If the RUn command has been used in the program
the button value that has been selected will be returned immediately by a DIALOG BOX or
DIALOG RUN command. Alternatively, a background dialogue box can have its buttons read
directly from an AMOS Professional main program, which is explained later.</p>

<p>Here are the BUtton command parameters, in order:</p>

<p>
After the BUtton instruction, the number of the button is specified, from 1 upwards. If several
buttons are to be linked together, they can be assigned the same number without causing any
problems at all. Each button can be individually tested by the RDIALOG function in an AMOS
Professional main program.</p>

<p>
The x,y coordinates hold the position of the button, relative to the BAse setting of the dialogue
box.</p>

<p>
The width and height parameters determine the size of the rectangular test zone that is to
enclose the new button, and are given in pixels as usual.</p>

<p>
Setting refers to an initial value setting for the new button, starting from zero. This indicates the
actual appearance of the position of the button on screen. In the case of a simple ON/OFF
button, a value of zero could indicate OFF, while 1 would indicate an ON setting. Normally, the
value of this setting will increase by one every time the button is "clicked", but this may be
changed directly, within your new button definition.</p>

<p>
The minimum and maximum parameters are used to set the range of the allowable button
settings. If the button exceeds the maximum limit, it is automatically set back to the minimum
setting.</p>

<p>
After these parameters have been specified, you are ready to draw the button on the screen. This
is defined using a simple list of Interface commands enclosed in square brackets. These
instructions can feature anything, including any of the Interface graphics operations. The semi-
colon in front of the first square bracket is essential!</p>

<p>
The drawing routine is first called when the button is initialised, and it is performed again every
time the button is activated by the user.</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the routine, the coordinate base is moved to the specified x,y position, and
the Size is set to the specified width and height. So all drawing operations are relative to the
start position of the current button. This means that there is no need to know the final location
of the button on the screen, so the button may be moved around by simply changing the
original coordinate values in x,y. The same drawing routines can also be used for several
different buttons.</p>

<p>
There is a second set of square brackets, which can remain empty, or contain optional
commands. These are used to define any "change" routine, to be called every time the button is
released.</p>
