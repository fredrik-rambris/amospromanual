<h1>Advanced Control Panels</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>Z</b>one<b>N</b>umber<br>
<i>Interface function: return the number of a zone</i><br>
number=<b>ZN</b></p>

<p>
The ZoneNumber function is used to return the number of the current zone. It is intended to be
used in conjunction with the ZoneChange command, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> [ZChange ZNumber 1+ZPosition] loads the next zone with existing position value.
</pre>

<p><b>Controlling a selector from the main program</b></p>

<p>
<p><b>DIALOG UPDATE</b><br>
instruction: update a zone<br>
<b>Dialog Update</b> channel number,zone number[,param1][,param2][,param3]</p>

<p>
This instruction enables AMOS Professional programs to force the Interface to re-draw a zone
on the screen. It is especially useful for selectors, which often need to interact directly with the
main program. These can include file selectors that need to read a new search path and update
the file list, as well as EDit routines that must load a selection window with a new value entered
by the user.</p>

<p>
The DIALOG UPDATE parameters are given in the following order: first the channel number of
an active dialogue channel to be updated. This is followed by the number of the zone to be
affected. There are also three parameters held inside their own set of square brackets, and the
effect of these parameters varies, depending on the type of the zone. Parameter I affects any of
the different zone types, whereas Parameters 2 and 3 affect active lists and sliders only. Here is a
table of the possibilities:</p>

<pre>
<b>Parameter 1</b>
Button         Enters a new status position
Active List    Sets the number of the first string displayed
Slider         Moves the slider
Digit          Replaces the existing number zone
Edit           Inserts a new string into the edit zone

<b>Parameter 2</b>
Active List Changes the currently selected string
Slider      Changes the size of the slider window

<b>Parameter 3</b>
Active List Chooses the last element of the array that can be selected. Normally
this parameter is equal to the size of the array, but it can be restricted
for certain applications.
Slider      Changes the "total" parameter
