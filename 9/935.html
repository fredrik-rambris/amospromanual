<h1>Advanced Control Panels</h1>

<br>

<pre>
Bit 1 is only active if the automatic numbering system has been turned on by setting Bit 0 to one.
      If this is the case, then the number count will start from one rather than zero, if Bit 1 is set
      to one.

Bit 2 changes the way the selector reacts to the mouse pointer. If it is set to zero, each line will
      react to the mouse immediately, with no need for a click of the mouse button. If Bit 2 is set
      to one, then items must be selected explicitly with the left mouse button.
</pre>

<p>The paper and pen parameters are the colour index numbers for the text in the item.</p>

<p>
Finally, the square brackets hold an Interface routine that determines any changes to be
executed every time one of the items is selected.</p>

<p>
Note that the text is displayed using a normal AMOS Professional window defined by the
number z+2000. Particular care should be taken if you are writing to the screen while reading a
selector. Return to the normal screen before printing, with a WINDOW 0 command, then use a
line like WINDOW Z+2000 to move the cursor back to the active window. If this is not done,
text will be printed inside the selection area!</p>

<p>
As with all of these techniques, there is a ready-made working example of an active window,
available for examination:</p>

<pre>
LD> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorials:Tutorial/Interface/Sliders.AMOS"
</pre>

<p>
<b>I</b>nactive<b>L</b>ist<br>
<i>Interface instruction: display an inactive list window</i><br>
<b>IL</b> zone number,x,y,width,height,address,index,flag,paper,pen;</p>

<p>
To display a window containing items in an array that are <b>not</b> for selection by the mouse, the
InactiveList command is used in much the same way as an ActiveList instruction except that
there is no [changes] parameter. Inactive windows are useful for generating simple lists on the
screen.</p>

<p>
Before using the AList or IList commands, some advance preparation should be carried out,
using the following steps:</p>

<p>First of all, define a string array to hold the items in memory, using a line like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Dim ITEM$(100)
</pre>

<p>
Next, load the items into the array. These items may be anything you wish, such as the
commands for an adventure game, or a set of filenames on a disc. The one factor that must be
ensured is that each item must have exactly the <b>same</b> number of characters. Use spaces to pad
items as necessary.</p>

<p>
The third step is to enter the Interface program into a string, and include an ActiveList
command. The following example line would create zone 1 at coordinates 10,10, with 15 lines of
30 characters each, taking the address of the item array from 0 VA.</p>

<pre>
X> AL 1,10,10,30,15,0 VA,0,0,0,1;[]
