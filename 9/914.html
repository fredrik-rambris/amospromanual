<h1>AMOS Interface</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Keyboard short-cuts</b><br>

Any of your buttons can be optionally assigned to an equivalent control-key combination from
the keyboard.</p>

<p><b>KY</b><br>
<i>Interface instruction: set keyboard short-cut</i><br>
<b>KY</b> ascii,shift</p>

<p>
The KY command requires two parameters. The first is the Ascii code of the chosen key (scan
codes can be entered by simply adding 128 to their value). The shift parameter is a bitmap which
allows a test to be made for one or more control keys, and the default value is zero. The full list
of possibilities is explained under the KEY SHIFT function in <a href="../10/1001.html">Chapter 10.1</a>.</p>

<p>
Once the keyboard short-cut has been defined, the button may be activated by pressing the
appropriate key. This will click the button on screen and release it immediately. Here are some
example settings:</p>

<pre>
X> KY 13,0      this is the return key
   KY 128 76+,0 this tests the up arrow key which has scan code 76
</pre>

<p><b>N</b>o<b>W</b>ait<br>
<i>Interface instruction: specify a quick release button</i><br>
<b>NW</b>;</p>

<p>
It is often necessary for buttons to take effect immediately, without waiting for the mouse key to
be released. The NoWait command is provided for this purpose, and it is normally used with a
BQuit instruction, or with routines that need to interact directly with an existing AMOS
Professional program. It is used like this:</p>

<pre>
X> BUtton 1,120,16,40,10,0,0,1;[In 1,0,0; GB 0,0,33,10; PR 1,2,'Quit',4;][NoWait,BQ;]
