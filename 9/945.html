<h1>Interface Resources</h1>

<br>

<p>
Each national grouping is provided with its own set of messages in the appropriate language,
and these messages can be used to generate multi-language programs.
The message number parameter enters the number of the message. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
D> For A=1 To 7
    Print Resource$(A)
   Next A
</pre>

<p>The following list shows the strings related to the various numbers:</p>

<pre>
<b>Number           Message</b>
>0               String from the Resource bank
0                Full pathname of APSystem folder
<0               Configuration system strings, as follows:
-1 to -9         Default file names
-10 to -36       All 26 extensions
38, -38          Communication ports
-40              Default cursor flashing
2001 to -2044    Miscellaneous strings used by Editor
-2045 to -2049   Editor system files
</pre>

<p><b>RESOURCE SCREEN OPEN</b><br>
<i>instruction: open a screen using the resource settings</i><br>
<b>Resource Screen Open</b> number,width,height,flash</p>

<p>
This instruction opens a screen using the settings that are stored in the Resource Bank. These
screen settings include the number of colours, the resolution and the entire colour palette.</p>

<p>
The parameters are given in the following order: the number of the screen to be defined from
zero to 7, the width of this screen in pixels and the height of the screen in lines. Finally a simple
flag is set for the flash feature, with a value of zero to turn off the flash, or any other appropriate
value to assign the flash effect to that colour index number.</p>

<p>The new screen will be installed with the colour palette held in the Resource Bank.</p>

<p>
The following example opens a screen using the settings from the internal Resource Bank, just
like the Editor screen, where the flashing colour is index number 2.</p>

<pre>
E> Resource Screen Open 0,640,200,2
</pre>

<p><b>RESOURCE UNPACK</b><br>
<i>instruction: unpack an image from the Resource Bank</i><br>
<b>Resource Unpack</b> number,x,y</p>

<p>
This AMOS Professional command unpacks a single element from the current Resource Bank
and displays it on the screen.</p>
