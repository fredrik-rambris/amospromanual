<h1>Interface Language</h1>

<br>

<p>
This Chapter deals with all of the AMOS Professional Interface general purpose programming
commands.</p>

<p>
The Interface is a complete language, and includes a full set of general instructions that can be
used to great effect in dialogue boxes. There is an extensive range of graphics commands, a
testing facility and a pair of important program control instructions for making jumps. The
Interface even provides fully-operative procedures and user-defined functions!</p>

<p><b>The graphics functions</b><br>

When defining a number of buttons, it is important to be able to arrange them neatly as part of
the display. The AMOS Professional Interface provides a number of simple functions to
shoulder the burden of these problems.</p>

<p>
As usual, these functions read their values directly from the number stack, so the numbers go
before the operations.</p>

<p><b>B</b>ase<b>X</b><br>
<b>B</b>ase<b>Y</b><br>
<i>Interface functions: get the coordinate base location</i><br>
x=<b>BX</b><br>
y=<b>BY</b></p>

<p>
These functions are used to return the screen coordinates that are to be used as the starting
point for all future calculations. These values are assumed to have been previously set with the
BAse instruction.</p>

<p>
<b>S</b>ize<b>X</b><br>
<b>S</b>ize<b>Y</b><br>
<i>Interface functions: get the size of the dialogue box</i><br>
width=<b>SX</b><br>
height=<b>SY</b></p>

<p>
Use these functions to provide the precise dimensions of the current dialogue box, as set with
the SIze command.</p>

<p>
<b>S</b>creen <b>W</b>idth<br>
<b>S</b>creen <b>H</b>eight<br>
<i>Interface functions: read dimensions of the current screen</i><br>
width=<b>SW</b><br>
height=<b>SH</b></p>

<p>
The SW and SH functions find the height and width of the current AMOS Professional screen.
They can be used in conjunction with the SX and SY functions to position a dialogue box neatly
in the centre of the display. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Size 240.100;
   BAse SW SX 2/-,SH SY 2/-;
</pre>
