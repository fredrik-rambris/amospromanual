<h1>AMOS Interface</h1>

<br>

<p><b>EX</b>it<br>
<i>Interface instruction: leave Interface and return to AMOS Professional Basic</i><br>
<b>EX</b>;</p>

<p>
The EXit command must always be the last instruction in an Interface program. It is used to
return to the more familiar environment of AMOS Professional Basic programs, by informing
I lie system that the last line of an Interface program has been reached. If the EXit command is
omitted, a syntax error will be generated when the routine is tested or run.</p>

<p><b>Variables and numbers</b><br>

The AMOS Professional Interface provides a standard way of performing calculations, and
saving the results into variables.</p>

<p>
All Interface programs have their own list of variables, stored in an internal array. These
variables have exactly the same format as ordinary AMOS Professional numbers.</p>

<p>
Each variable is referred to by an index number, from zero upwards. However, instead of
reading an array in the conventional way, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> VARIABLE(index number)
</pre>

<p>Interface variables must have the item number placed first, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> index number VARIABLE
</pre>

<p><b>VA</b>riable<br>
<i>Interface function: return value held by an index</i><br>
value=index number <b>VA</b>;</p>

<p>
VA will return the value associated with the item number index, making it available for your
Interface program. As a default, up to 17 variables can be used at one time, but this number can
be increased via the DIALOG OPEN command, which is explained later.</p>

<p><b>Setting a variable</b></p>

<p><b>S</b>et <b>V</b>ariable<br>
<i>Interface instruction: set an Interface variable</i><br>
<b>SV</b> index number,value;</p>

<p>
Setting a variable for the AMOS Professional Interface is very easy. Simply give the command,
followed by the number of the variable to be changed and the value to be entered. Interface
variables are not limited to numbers, and complete strings of characters may be assigned as
necessary. For example:</p>


<pre>
X> SetVar 0,42:                   this loads the value forty two into item number zero.
   SetVar 1,'The answer is';      this loads a string into item number one.
</pre>
