<h1>Interface Resources</h1>

<br>

<p>
These components can be re-used to produce a large number of possible displays, such as in the
next example diagram:</p>

<pre>
[1|2|2|2|3]
[4|5|5|5|6]
[4|5|5|5|6]
[7|8|8|8|9]
</pre>


<p>
<b>PU</b>sh<br>
<i>Interface instruction: push image to an offset position in the Resource Bank</i><br>
<b>PU</b> offset;</p>

<p>
The PUsh command sets an offset value to the first image in the Resource Bank, and this offset
will be added to all subsequent image numbers. This means that you can make a dialogue box
totally independent from the images in the Resource Bank. For example, if new images are
added at the beginning of the bank at any subsequent time, the images used by your existing
resource commands will be pushed down the required number of places, and they will work
perfectly without any changes in numbering required. To demonstrate this, the following two
lines would have exactly the same effect:</p>

<pre>
X> PUsh 0; UNpack 0,0,13;
   PUsh 13; UNpack 0,0,0;
</pre>

<p><b>The Resource commands</b><br>

Here is a full explanation of the additional AMOS Professional instructions and functions that
can be used to exploit the Resource Bank.</p>

<p><b>RESOURCE BANK</b><br>
<i>instruction: select a bank to be used for resources</i><br>
<b>Resource Bank</b> number</p>

<p>
This command is used to tell AMOS Professional in which bank the resources to be used by
Interface programs are kept. The number parameter holds the number of the memory bank to
be allocated. If this bank does not exist, the Editor's internal resource bank will be used as a
default. This means that after this command has been called, you can return to the Editor
resources by employing a dummy value, such as zero. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
X> Load "Resource.Abk",16 : Rem This can be any filename
   Resource Bank 16: Rem Set resources to Bank 16
</pre>

<p><b>RESOURCE$</b><br>
<i>function: read a message from the Resource Bank</i><br>
message=<b>Resource$</b>(message number)</p>

<p>
The RESOURCE$ function returns one of the messages from the current Resource Bank, to be
used by an AMOS Professional program. If the bank has not been defined, the standard Editor
messages will be made available from the Configuration file.</p>
