<h1>AMOS Interface</h1>

<br>

<p>
Note that there is <b>no semi-colon</b> after this final set of brackets. if one is included a syntax error
will be generated when the program is run. Beware of making this very easy mistake!</p>

<p>
Whenever a button is selected by the user, the AMOS Professional Interface performs the
following sequence of actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The button setting is incremented by one, and this new setting is compared to the values held
      in the minimum and maximum parameters.</li>
  <li>The commands held in the button drawing routine are now executed on screen.</li>
  <li>The system waits for the mouse key to be released</li>
  <li>If it has been defined, the "change" routine is now performed. This can change the setting
      value of any button on the screen, allowing you to link several buttons together. If the
      "change" commands move one or more buttons to a new setting, they will be updated with an
      appropriate call to the relevant drawing routine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of button definitions:</p>

<pre>
X> BU 1,80,38,50,10,0,0,1; set position and size of button number one
   [PR 1,2,'Button 1',6;][] draw button using a simple print command

   BU 2,10,38,50,10,0,0,1;[PR 1,2,'Button 2',7;][]
</pre>

<p><b>B</b>utton<b>Q</b>uit<br>
<i>Interface instruction: trigger an exit button</i><br>
<b>BQ</b>;</p>

<p>
There are special buttons featured in the Editor requesters, such as [Ok] and [Cancel], which are
used to leave the dialogue box the moment that they are selected by the user. These "Exit"
buttons are created using the Button Quit instruction. This command can be placed inside the
"change" brackets in order to trigger a forced exit from the dialogue box after the button has
been selected. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> BU 1,80,38,50,10,0,0,1 ;[PR 1,2,'Button 1',6;][BQ;]
</pre>

<p><b>Drawing a button</b><br>

Buttons can be drawn in a variety of styles, using any of the Interface graphics commands. A full
list of all these commands is fully explained in <a href="915.html">Chapter 9.2</a>. Here are some typical options:</p>

<p>Text buttons can be created by enclosing the required text with a box or a filled bar, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> BUtton 1,20,16,50,10,0,0,1;
   [INk 4,0,0;GraphicSquare 0,0,50,10; PRint 1,2,'Button',6;][]

X> BUtton 2,120,16,40,1,0,0,1;
   [INk 1,0,0; GraphicBox 0,0,33,10; PRint 1,2,'Quit',4;][ButtonQuit;]
</pre>
