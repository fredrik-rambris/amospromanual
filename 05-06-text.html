    <h1>Text</h1>

    <p>This Chapter explains how to use the advantages of AMOS Professional for handling written
        text. You may want to remind yourself of the visible character set by running this simple
        routine:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">For 0=32 To 255
 Print Chr$(C);" =Ascii Code";
 Print Asc(Chr$(C)) : Wait 10
Next C
</code>

<section id="01-printing-on-the-screen">
    <h2>Printing on the screen</h2>

    <p>The PRINT instruction is one of the most familiar command words in most Basic languages.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-print">PRINT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: print items on screen</i><br>
        <b>Print</b> items</p>

    <p>Items are printed on the screen, starting from the current cursor position, and they may include
        the characters in any group of variables or constants, up to the maximum line length of 255
        characters. The PRINT command is also used to display graphics and information on screen, as
        is demonstrated throughout this User Guide. This Chapter will deal with printing text only.</p>

    <p>Print statements can occupy their own lines, but if more than one element to be printed is
        written as a single line of your program, each element must be separated from the next by either
        a semi-colon character or a comma. An element to be printed can be a string, a variable or a
        constant, and is placed inside a pair of quotation marks.</p>

    <p>A semi-colon is used to print elements immediately after one another, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "Follow";"on"</code>

    <p>A comma moves the cursor to the next "Tab" position on the screen, as follows:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "Next","Tab"</code>

    <p>A Tab is an automatic marker that sets up a location for printing, and is often used to lay out
        columns of figures, or to make indentations in text, and setting Tab positions is explained later.</p>

    <p>Normally, the cursor is advanced downwards by one line after every PRINT command, but by
        using the semi-colon or comma, the rule can be changed. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "AMOS"
Print "Professional"
Print "AM";
Print "OS",
Print "Professional"
</code>
</section>

<section id="02-setting-text-options">
    <h2>Setting text options</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-pen">PEN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set the colour of text</i><br>
        <b>Pen</b> index number</p>

    <p>This command sets the colour of the text displayed in the current window, when followed by
        the colour index number of your choice. The default setting of the pen colour is index number 2,
        which is white, and alternative colours may be selected from one of up to 64 choices, depending
        on the current graphics mode. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">For INDEX=0 To 15
 Pen INDEX
 Print "Pen number ";INDEX
Next INDEX
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-pen-dollar">PEN$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return a control index number to set the pen colour</i><br>
        p$=Pen$(index number)</p>

    <p>This function returns a special control sequence that changes the pen colour inside a string.
        This means that whenever the string is printed on the screen, the pre-set pen colour is
        automatically assigned to it. The format of the string returned by PEN$ is:
        Chr$(27)+"Pen"+Chr$(48+number). Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">P$=Pen$(2)+"Well all WHITE, "+Pen$(6)+" I still got the BLUES"
Print P$
Pen 4
Print "In the RED"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-paper">PAPER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set colour of text background</i><br>
        <b>Paper</b> index number</p>

    <p>To select a background colour on which your text is to be printed, the PAPER command is
        followed by a colour index number between 0 and 63, depending on the graphics mode in use,
        in exactly the same way as PEN. The normal default colour index number is 1, giving an orange
        background colour, with other possibilities listed under the SCREEN OPEN command in this
        User Guide. Run the following simple example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Pen 2: For INDEX=0 To 15
Paper INDEX: Print "Paper number ";INDEX;Space$(23)
Next INDEX
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-paper-dollar">PAPER$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return a control index number to set background colour</i><br>
        b$=<b>PAPER$</b>(index number)</p>

    <p>Similarly to the PEN$ function, PAPER$ returns a character string that automatically sets the
        background colour when the string is printed on the screen. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Pen 1
B$=Paper$(3)+"Flash Harry"+Paper$(1)+"The Invisible Man"
Print B$
</code>
</section>

<section id="03-changing-text-options">
    <h2>Changing text options</h2>

    <p>
        <b>INVERSE ON/OFF</b><br>
        <i>instructions: toggle inverse mode of subsequent text</i><br>
        <b>Inverse On</b><br>
        <b>Inverse Off</b></p>

    <p>The INVERSE instruction swaps over the text and background colours already selected by the
        PEN and PAPER commands, and so sets up an inverse mode for printing. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Pen 2 : Paper 4: Print "I appear normal"
Inverse On : Print "Poetry inverse"
Inverse Off : Print "Don't be so negative"
</code>

    <p>
        <b>SHADE ON/OFF</b><br>
        <i>instructions: toggle shading of subsequent text</i><br>
        <b>Shade On</b><br>
        <b>Shade Off</b></p>

    <p>The appearance of your text can be changed more subtly by introducing a mask pattern that
        reduces the brightness of the characters when printed. To make use of this shading facility,
        simply turn it on and off like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Shade On :Print "Shady Lady"
Shade Off:Print "Norman Normal"
</code>
</section>

<section id="04-setting-text-styles">
    <h2>Setting text styles</h2>

    <p>As well as customising the appearance of your text by changing the text options, you can also
        use the standard type-face techniques available to printers and word processors.</p>

    <p>
        <b>UNDER ON/OFF</b><br>
        <i>instructions: toggle underline mode of subsequent text</i><br>
        <b>Under On</b><br>
        <b>Under Off</b></p>


    <p>To underline text when printed on screen like this, use the UNDER instructions, as follows:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Under On : Print "This is where we draw the line"
Under Off: "That is groundless"
</code>

    <p>In <a href="11-01-fonts.html">Section 11.1</a> there is a full explanation of how to take advantage of any number of different
        type faces or fonts, by making use of what is known as "graphic text". For the time being, try the
        next example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls: For S=0 To 7: Set Text S
Text 100,S*20+20,AMOS Professional" : Next S
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-set-text">SET TEXT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set the style of a text font</i><br>
        <b>Set Text</b> style number</p>

    <p>The SET TEXT command allows you to change the style of a font by selecting one of eight
        different styles that are produced by mixing the following three elements</p>

    <pre>
Bit 0 <u>Underline</u>
Bit 1 <b>Bold</b>
Bit 2 <i>Italic</i>
</pre>


    <p>Set the appropriate bits in the form of a style number from 0 to 7, as in the last example.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-text-styles">TEXT STYLES</h3>
    <p><i>function: return current text style</i><br>
        s=<b>Text Styles</b></p>

    <p>This function returns the index reference of the text style you last selected using SET TEXT. The
        result is a bit-map in the same format as explained above:</p>

    <pre>
Set Text 2: Print "Style Two"
Print Text Styles
</pre>
</section>

<section id="05-changing-the-text-mode">
    <h2>Changing the text mode</h2>

    <p>For even more flexibility in presenting your text on screen, you can select the way it is combined
        with other screen data.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-writing">WRITING</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: select text writing mode of subsequent text</i><br>
        <b>Writing</b> value1<br>
        <b>Writing</b> value1,optional value2</p>

    <p>The WRITING command is used to control how the subsequent text interacts with what is
        already on the screen, and it can be followed by either one or two values.</p>


    <p>The first value selects one of five writing modes:</p>

    <pre>
<b>Value   Mode        Effect</b>
0       REPLACE     New text replaces any existing screen data
1       OR          Merge new text with screen data, using logical OR
2       XOR         Combine new text with screen data, using OR
3       AND         Combine new text and screen data, using logical AND
4       IGNORE      Ignore all subsequent printing instructions
</pre>

    <p>A number set as the optional second value selects which parts of the text are to be printed on the
        screen, as follows:</p>


    <pre>
<b>Value Mode   Effect</b>
0     Normal Print text and background together
1     Paper  Only the background to be drawn on screen
2     Pen    Ignore paper colour and print text on background colour zero
</pre>

    <p>The default value for both of the WRITING parameters is zero, giving normal printed output.</p>
</section>

<section id="06-positioning-the-text-cursor">
    <h2>Positioning the text cursor</h2>

    <p>Characters are always printed at the current position of the text cursor, and the AMOS
        Professional programmer is offered several methods of controlling the cursor in order to make
        text look more orderly, attractive or eye-catching.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-locate">LOCATE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: position the text cursor</i><br>
        <b>Locate</b> x,<br>
        <b>Locate</b> ,y<br>
        <b>Locate</b> x,y</p>

    <p>This command moves the text cursor to the coordinates of your choice, and this new location
        sets the start position for all subsequent text printing until you command otherwise. All screen
        positions are measured in "text coordinates", which are measured in units of one printed
        character on screen, with the x-coordinate controlling the horizontal position and the y-
        coordinate referring to the vertical. So, the top left-hand corner of the screen has coordinates of
        0,0 whereas text coordinates of 15,10 refer to a position 15 characters from the left-hand edge of
        the screen and 10 characters from the top.</p>

    <p>The range of these coordinates will depend on the size of your character set and the dimensions
        of the display area allocated, known as a "window". All coordinate measurements are taken
        using text coordinates relative to the current window. If you try and print something outside of
        these limits, an error will be generated. Windows are dealt with in the next Section, but the
        current screen is automatically treated as a window, so there is no need to "open" one to test the
        following examples:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "0,0": Locate 10, : Print "Stay on current line"
Locate ,5 : Print "Six from the top."
Locate 10,10 : Print "Ten down and ten across"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-home">HOME</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: force text cursor home</i><br>
        <b>Home</b></p>

    <p>
        Whenever you need to move the text cursor back to the top left-hand corner of the screen in a
        hurry, simply tell it to go HOME and it will automatically be relocated to coordinates 0,0 like
        this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls: Locate 10,10: Print "I am going"
Wait 100: Home : Print "Home!"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-cmove">CMOVE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move text cursor</i><br>
        <b>Cmove</b> width<br>
        <b>Cmove</b> height<br>
        <b>Cmove</b> width,height</p>

    <p>It is also possible to move the text cursor a pre-set distance away from its current position, which
        can come in useful if you need to show speech bubbles or shunt your text to one side
        temporarily. The CMOVE command is followed by a pair of variables that represent the width
        and height of the required offset, and these values are added to the current cursor coordinates.
        Like LOCATE, either of the coordinates can be omitted, as long as the comma is positioned
        correctly. An additional technique is to use negative values as well as positive offsets. For
        example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls : Print "Iceland"
Cmove 5,5: Print "Scotland";
Cmove ,-3 : Print "Norway"
Cmove 10,14: Print "France"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-cmove-dollar">CMOVE$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return control string to move text cursor</i><br>
        a$=<b>Cmove$</b>(x,y)</p>

    <p>Characters can be printed relative to the current cursor position by setting up a string using the
        CMOVE$ function. The following example prints a string at coordinates 10,10 from the current
        text cursor:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">A$=Cmove$(10,10)
A$=A$+"AMOS Professional"
Print A$
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-at">AT</h3>
    <p><i>function: return a string to position the text cursor</i><br>
        a$=<b>At</b>(x,y)</p>

    <p>You may also change the position of the text cursor directly from inside a character string. This
        is ideal for positioning text once and for all on screen, no matter what happens in the program,
        because the text cursor can be set during the program's initialisation phase. The string that is
        returned takes the following format:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">A$="A"+At(10,10)+"Of"+At(2,4)+"String"+At(20,20)+"Pearls"
Print A$
</code>

    <p>Imagine a Hi-Score table positioned like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">SCORE=999
Locate 12,10: Print "Hi Score ";SCORE
</code>

    <p>By using the AT function, the same table can be moved by editing a single string, no matter how
        many times it is used in the program, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">SCORE=999
Locate 12,10: Print "Hi Score ";SCORE
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-centre">CENTRE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: print text centrally on current line</i><br>
        <b>Centre</b> a$</p>

    <p>Programmers often need to position text in the centre of the screen, and to save you the effort of
        calculating the text coordinates in order to achieve this, the CENTRE command takes a string of
        characters and prints it in the middle of the line currently occupied by the cursor.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Locate 0,1
Centre "ABOVE"
Cmove ,3
Centre "suspicion"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-tab-dollar">TAB$</h3>
    <p><i>function: move text cursor to next Tab</i><br>
        t$=<b>Tab$</b></p>

    <p>The TAB$ function returns a special control character called TAB, which carries the Ascii code of
        9. When this character is printed, the text cursor is automatically moved to the next tabulated
        column setting (Tab) to the right.</p>

    <p>The default setting for this is four characters, which can be changed as follows:</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-set-tab">SET TAB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: change Tab setting</i><br>
        <b>Set Tab</b> number</p>

    <p>This simple command specifies the number of characters that the text cursor will move to the
        right when the next TAB$ is printed. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls : Print "Home"
Print Tab$;"And"
Set Tab 10 : Print Tab$;"Away"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-cdown">CDOWN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move text cursor down</i><br>
        <b>Cdown</b></p>

    <p>Use this command to force the text cursor down a single line, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls: Print "Over" : Cdown : Print "the Moon"</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-cdown-dollar">CDOWN$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return control character to move text cursor down</i><br>
        c$=<b>Cdown$</b></p>

    <p>The effect of summoning up the special control character (Ascii 31) is exactly the same as
        printing after a CDOWN command. The advantage of this alternative is that several text cursor
        movements can be combined in a single string, using CDOWN$.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">C$="Going Down"+Cdown$
For A=0 To 20
 Print C$
Next A
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-cup">CUP</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move text cursor one line up</i><br>
        <b>Cup</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-cleft">CLEFT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move text cursor one character left</i><br>
        <b>Cleft</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-cright">CRIGHT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move text cursor one character right</i><br>
        <b>Cright</b></p><br>

    <p>These three commands are self-explanatory, and work in exactly the same way as CDOWN.
        their equivalent functions are listed below, and work in the same way as CDOWN$:</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-cup-dollar">CUP$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return control character (30) to move cursor up one line</i><br>
        x$=<b>Cup$</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-cleft-dollar">CLEFT$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return control character (29) to move cursor left one character</i><br>
        x$=<b>Cleft$</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-cright-dollar">CRIGHT$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return control character (28) to move cursor right one character</i><br>
        x$=<b>Cright$</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-cline">CLINE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: clear some or all text on current cursor line</i><br>
        <b>Cline</b><br>
        <b>Cline</b> number</p>

    <p>This command is used to clear the line currently occupied by the text cursor. If CLINE is
        qualified by a number, then that number of characters get cleared, starting from the current
        cursor position and leaving the cursor exactly where it is. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "Testing Testing Testing";
Cmove -7,
Cline 7
Wait Key
Cline
</code>
</section>

<section id="07-tracking-the-text-cursor">
    <h2>Tracking the text cursor</h2>

    <p>To track down the exact position of the text cursor, the following pair of functions may be used</p>

    <p>
        <b>XCURS</b><br>
        <i>function: return the x-coordinate of the text cursor</i><br>
        x=<b>Xcurs</b></p>

    <p>
        <b>YCURS</b><br>
        <i>function: return the y-coordinate of the text cursor</i><br>
        y=<b>Ycurs</b></p>

    <p>In this way, a variable is created that holds the relevant coordinate of the cursor, in text format,
        and these two functions may be used independently or together. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Locate 5,10: Print Xcurs; : Print Ycurs</code>

    <p>
        <b>MEMORIZE X/Y</b><br>
        <i>instructions: save the x or y text cursor coordinates</i><br>
        <b>Memorize X</b><br>
        <b>Memorize Y</b></p>

    <p>The MEMORIZE commands store the current position of the x or y text cursor, so that you can
        print any text on the screen without destroying the original cursor coordinates. These may be
        reloaded using the REMEMBER commands, as follows:</p>

    <p>
        <b>REMEMBER X/Y</b><br>
        <i>instructions: restore the x or y text cursor coordinates</i><br>
        <b>Remember X</b><br>
        <b>Remember Y</b></p>

    <p>Use REMEMBER to position the text cursor at the coordinates saved by a previous MEMORIZE
        command. If MEMORIZE has not been used, the relevant coordinate will automatically be set to
        zero. There is a ready-made example demonstrating these commands to be found under the SET
        CURS command, which is below.</p>
</section>

<section id="08-changing-the-text-cursor">
    <h2>Changing the text cursor</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-curs-pen">CURS PEN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: select colour of text cursor</i><br>
        <b>Curs Pen</b> index number</p>

    <p>As a default, whenever your screen mode provides four or more colours the text cursor is set to
        index number 3, which is endowed with a built-in flash. The flashing can be turned off and back
        on again at any time using the FLASH OFF and FLASH commands, but as soon as you select
        another colour for your text cursor, the automatic flash will not apply. To change colours, use
        the CURS PEN command, followed by the index number of your choice. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Curs Pen 2</code>

    <p>Note that the new colour only effects the text cursor in the current open window, and has no
        influence over other cursors used by any other windows. If you want to introduce a flash to that
        last example, you could add this line before the CURS PEN command:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Flash 2,"(FFF,15)(000,15)"</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-set-curs">SET CURS</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set the shape of the text cursor</i><br>
        <b>Set Curs</b> L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6,L7,L8</p>

    <p>To customise the text cursor into something a little more personalised, you can change its shape
        into anything you like, providing you limit yourself to the eight lines of eight bits each that
        represent its appearance. Lines are numbered one to eight from top to bottom, and every bit set
        to 1 results in a pixel drawn in the current cursor pen colour, whereas a zero displays the current
        paper colour. To familiarise yourself with the technique, try the next example, which changes
        the text cursor into a Halloween mask:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">L1=%00111100
L2=%01111110
L3=%01011010
L4=%11100111
L5=%10111101
L6=%01011010
L7=%00100100
L8=%00011000
Set Curs L1 L2 , L3 L4 L5, L6 , L7, L8
</code>

    <p>Your routine will appear slightly different from that, because the system automatically strips
        away any leading zeros in binary listings.</p>

    <p>
        <b>CURS ON/OFF</b><br>
        <i>instructions: toggle text cursor</i><br>
        <b>Curs On</b><br>
        <b>Curs Off</b></p>

    <p>This pair of commands is use to hide and reveal the text cursor in the current window. It has no
        effect at all on any cursors used in other windows.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-zone-dollar">ZONE$</h3>
    <p><i>function: create a zone around text</i><br>
        z$=<b>ZONE$</b>(text$,zone number)</p>

    <p>
        The AMOS Professional programmer is allowed to create powerful dialogue boxes and on-
        screen control panels without the need to employ complex programming. The ZONES function
        surrounds a section of text with its own screen zone, so that the presence of the mouse pointer
        can be detected using the ZONE function. Simply supply the two parameters in brackets, which
        are the string of text for one of your control "buttons", followed by the number of the screen
        zone to be defined.</p>

    <p>The maximum number of zones will be limited by the value specified in a previous RESERVE
        ZONE command. The format for the control string is as follows:</p>

    <pre>
Chr$(27)+"ZO"+A$+Chr$(27)+"R"+Chr$(48+n)
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-border-dollar">BORDER$</h3>
    <p><i>function: create a border around text</i><br>
        b$=<b>Border$</b>(text$, border number)</p>

    <p>This works in much the same way as ZONES, by returning a string of characters that create a
        border around the required string of text. The AMOS Professional programmer can use it with
        ZONES to set up special "buttons" for alert windows and control consoles.</p>

    <p>In this case, the text held in the string will start at the current text cursor position. Border
        numbers can range from 1 to 16, for example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Locate 1,1: Print Border$("AMOS Professional",2)</code>

    <p>The control sequence returned by BORDER has the following format:</p>

    <pre>
Chr$(27)+"E0"+A$+Chr$(27)+"R"+Chr$(48+n)
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-hscroll">HSCROLL</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: scroll text horizontally</i><br>
        <b>Hscroll</b> number</p>

    <p>This command scrolls all text in the current open window horizontally, by a single character
        position. The following numbers can be used:</p>

    <pre>
<b>Number Effect</b>
1      Scroll current line to the left
2      Scroll entire screen to the left
3      Scroll current line to the right
4      Scroll entire screen to the right
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-vscroll">VSCROLL</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: scroll text vertical</i><br>
        <b>Vscroll</b> number</p>

    <p>Similarly to HSCROLL, the values given to this command result in different vertical scrolling
        effects, one character at a time.</p>


    <pre>
<b>Number Effect</b>
1      Scroll down text on and below current cursor Line
2      Scroll down text from top of screen to current cursor line only
3      Scroll up text from top of screen to current cursor line only
4      Scroll up text on or below current cursor line
</pre>

    <p>Note that blank lines are inserted to fill any gaps left by these scrolling operations.</p>

<section id="10-advanced-printing">
    <h2>Advanced printing</h2>

    <p>The AMOS Professional programmer is not restricted to the standard PRINT command for
        displaying information.</p>

    <p>
        <b>?</b><br>
        <i>instruction: print</i><br>
        <b>Print</b></p>

    <p>The question mark character (?) can be used instead of PRINT as a keyboard short-cut.</p>

    <!-- section -->

    <p>When used in this way, it is automatically displayed as PRINT as soon as the line has been
        entered into your listing.</p>

<code class="prefix edit">? "AMOS Professional"</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-using">USING</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: format printed output</i><br>
        <b>Print Using</b> format$;variable list</p>

    <p>USING is always employed with the PRINT command to allow subtle changes in the way
        output is printed from a list of variables. The format string contains special characters, and each
        one has a different effect, as explained below.</p>

    <p>
        <b>~</b><br>
        <i>tilde character [Shift]+[#]</i></p>

    <p>Every ~ in the string variable is replaced by a single character from left to right, taken from an
        output string. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Using "This is a ~~~~~~ example";"simple"</code>

    <p>
        <b>#</b><br>
        <i>hash character</i></p>

    <p>Each # specifies one digit at a time, to be printed out from a given variable, with any unused
        digits being replaced by spaces. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Using "###";123456</code>

    <p>
        <b>+</b><br>
        <i>plus character</i></p>

    <p>This adds a plus sign to a positive number or a minus sign if the number is negative. For
        example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Using "+##";10 : Print Using "+##";-10</code>

    <p>
        <b>-</b><br>
        <i>minus character</i></p>

    <p>This gives a minus sign to negative numbers only. Positive numbers will be preceded by a space.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Using "-##";10:Print Using "-##";-10</code>

    <p>
        <b>.</b><br>
        <i>full stop character</i></p>

    <p>When used with PRINT USING, the full stop (period) character places a decimal point in a
        number, and automatically centres it on screen. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Using ".###";Pi#</code>

    <p>
        <b>;</b><br>
        <i>semi-colon character</i></p>

    <p>This centres a number, but will not output a decimal point. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Using "Pl is #;###";Pi#</code>

    <p>
        <b>^</b><br>
        <i>exponential (circumflex) character [Shift]+[6]</i></p>

    <p>This causes a number to be printed out in exponential format. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Using "This is an exponential number^";10000*10000.5</code>

    <h2>Sending text to a printer</h2>

    <p><a href="10-03-accessing-a-printer.html">Chapter 10.3</a> is devoted to the exploitation of the printer device by AMOS Professional. The
        following command offers easy access to a printer from inside an AMOS Professional program
        or via Direct mode.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-lprint">LPRINT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: output a list of variables to a printer</i><br>
        <b>Lprint</b> variable list</p>

    <p>The LPRINT command is exactly the same as a PRINT command, but it sends data to a printer
        instead of the screen, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Lprint "Greetings from AMOS Professional!"</code>
