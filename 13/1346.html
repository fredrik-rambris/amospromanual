<h1>the Sample Bank Maker</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Delete a sample</b><br>

<img alt="Delete sample button"
     src="../images/1346delete.jpg" align="left" />

This is a powerful control button, and care should be taken when using it!<br>
The highlighted sample is totally erased from the sample bank, and it can not be recovered.</p>


<p><b>Clear sample bank</b><br>

<img alt="Clear sample button"
     src="../images/1346clear.jpg" align="left" />

To clear the entire sample bank, use this button.<br> Again, it must be emphasised that once
the samples in the bank have been erased from memory, they cannot be recovered.
Always keep back-up copies of your samples on another disc.</p>

<p><b>Save As</b><br>

<img alt="SaveAs button"
     src="../images/1346saveas.jpg" align="left" />

To save the edited sample bank with a new identity onto disc, the [Save As] option
should be used.<br>
After a prompt, you can type in the new name for the bank, which will
appear above the sample bank window.</p>

<p><b>Save bank</b><br>

<img alt="Save bank button"
     src="../images/1346savebank.jpg" align="left" />

If you do not need to change the name of the bank, simply trigger the [Save Bank]
button,<br>
and it will be saved to the current disc.</p>


<p><b>Quit</b><br>

<img alt="Quit button"
     src="../images/1346quit.jpg" align="left" />

To leave the Sample Bank Maker, use the [QUIT] button, which is at the top of the
screen, and you will be returned to the familiar AMOS Professional Edit Screen.</p>
