<h1>the AMAL Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>Here is a list of the editing controls:</p>

<pre>
[Return]                   Insert a line
[Ctrl]+[Y]                 Delete a line
[Tab]                      Jump to next Tab position
[Cursor arrows]            Move cursor one place up, down, left or right
[Shift]+[Cursor arrows]    Move cursor to start / end of line, or top / bottom of screen
</pre>

<p><b>Lower drag bar</b><br>
At the bottom of the String Editor Screen, there is a black bar, which can be dragged vertically
using the left mouse button, to reveal the current program display.</p>

<p><b>The AMAL Editor Menus</b><br>

There are five drop-down menus, located along the left-hand side of the Information Line.
These are called up and activated using the right mouse button. Here is a guided tour of all the
menu options, from left to right.</p>

<p><b>AMOS menu</b><br>

This simple menu offers the following three options:</p>

<p><b>[About AMAL Editor]</b><br>
This displays a memory status report, showing the current text buffer free space, free chip
memory and free fast memory.</p>

<p><b>[Quit Esc]</b><br>
To get back to the AMOS Professional Edit window, click on the [Quit] option, or press the [Esc]
key. You will be asked to confirm your action with a [Y/N1.</p>

<p><b>[Back to system]</b><br>
This will leave AMOS Professional altogether, and take you to the Workbench screen. If you
insist on leaving the comforts of AMOS Professional, you should trigger the [Really?] option.</p>

<p><b>Edit menu</b><br>

Once AMAL programs have been loaded into memory, they can be run using one of the options
in the Edit menu, triggered by the right mouse button, as before. Here is the choice of available
options:</p>

<p><b>[Run All] or [F1]</b><br>
This calls the AMAL Environment string, which is explained later, and executes all existing
AMAL programs simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>[Run Current] or [F2]</b><br>
Trigger this option to initialise the screen and execute the single AMAL program that is currently
being edited. Once the program is running, you may return to the AMAL Editor window at any
time by pressing a key.</p>
