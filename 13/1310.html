<h1>the Object Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
At the top of this stack are three double-height coloured blocks. The first two colour blocks show
the colours currently under the control of the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> mouse buttons, when used for
drawing. The third double-height colour block shows the colour currently used when <b>both</b>
mouse buttons are pressed at once, when drawing.</p>

<p><b>COLOUR PALETTE</b><br>
The vertical display of all the colours in the current palette can be seen below the mouse colours.
The total umber of the palette colours depends on what sort of "resolution" is being used, and if
64 colours are available, then colours numbered from 32 to 63 will appear in order, side by side
of colours zero to 31. To select a colour, place the mouse pointer over your choice, and click
either the left or right mouse button to allocate that colour to that button. A third colour can be
selected by pressing both buttons, and it is used when both buttons are depressed. Obviously, if
you have a three-button mouse, choosing and using the third colour is easier. Select a pair of
contrasting colours now, such as white and bright red.</p>

<p><b>CURRENT DISPLAY</b><br>
Now look at the vertical stack of zones at the right-hand side of the screen. At the top of this
stack, immediately below the [UNDO] icon, there is a square box which displays the "fill
pattern" currently available for use. Place the mouse pointer inside it now, and run through all
the available fill patterns, using the left button to move forwards and the right button to go
backwards through the list. This box is also used to display a read-out of the coordinates of the
mouse pointer when images are edited.</p>

<p><b>BANK DISPLAY</b><br>
Beneath the Current Display box, the images in the current bank are displayed one on top of the
other, and the number of each image appears <b>above</b> it. Each image is shrunk in size so that all of
it may be viewed in its own rectangular display box. To select an image for attention, click the
mouse pointer on it, and you will see that its number becomes <b>highlighted</b>. Any image that is
currently being edited is marked with an asterisk star (*) in front of its number.</p>

<p><b>BANK SLIDER</b><br>
To the right of the stack where the bank of images will appear, there is a vertical slider bar.
Because there can be hundreds of images in any one bank, and there can only be enough space
to view a few of them at a time, this slider is pulled up and down with the mouse pointer to
display other images in the bank. Use it now to view all the images currently loaded.</p>

<p><b>SCREEN SIZER</b><br>
To the right-of-centre of the screen is a narrow vertical bar, which can be dragged to the left or
right using the mouse pointer, if you need to change the proportions of the Edit Screen. The
right-hand zone is the EDIT WINDOW, where images that are being edited are viewed in actual
size. The left-hand zone is the ZOOM WINDOW area, where you can view your work in close-
up, as it progresses.</p>

<p><b>ZOOM WINDOW</b><br>
The Zoom Window displays a blow-up version of the image, allowing greater accuracy and ease
of use while editing. The zoom is normally set to double the size of the original graphics,
and there is an option to make this four times the size, which is explained later.</p>
