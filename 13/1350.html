<h1>the Resource Creator</h1>

<br>

<p><b>[Grab One Element]</b><br>

The source picture is brought to the front of the display, and you may now position the pointer
over any selected part of the picture to create an item by clicking on a corner of the area to be
grabbed and dragging a box around it, using the <b>left</b> mouse button. When this button is
released, the box can be positioned directly over the object, using the mouse. Another click on
the <b>left</b> mouse button grabs it into memory.</p>

<p>
As you work, an instant read-out of the current settings is given, making it easy to fine-tune
objects to their optimum size. Mistakes are of no importance, and you may abort the operation
at any time by pressing the <b>right</b> mouse button. Please note that the colour of the highlighted
box can be changed by pressing the [Spacebar] key. The colour shift becomes visible when you
next move the mouse.</p>

<p>
Once an object has been grabbed in this way, it will be added to the list of elements in the
selection window. If you click on it, it will be shown on the screen at its current position,
enclosed by a flashing bar.</p>

<p><b>[Grab Horiz Line]</b><br>

This option is used to grab a group of <b>three</b> elements for the Start, Middle and End components
of a horizontal line. All that needs to be done is to drag a box around the line, as explained
above, and the Resource Editor will take care of everything else automatically. The line will be
divided into the three components and stored in the memory bank accordingly. It can now be
called directly with a LIne command to generate lines of any length.</p>

<p>
Since each line is created in the manner that is explained above, the width of the line must be an
exact multiple of 24. The Resource Editor will take this into account when objects are grabbed,
but there are no such limitations with regard to the original position of your horizontal lines.
These can be grabbed from any part of the source picture.</p>

<p><b>[Grab Vert Line]</b><br>

Similarly, this grabs three elements for a vertical line. As with horizontal lines, the entire process
is automated. Simply position the mouse pointer over the top left-hand corner of the proposed
line, hold down the left mouse button and drag a box around the required image. When the
button is released, you may re-position the box as required, and click once again on the left
mouse button to load it into memory.</p>

<p>
Note that the width of vertical lines must be a multiple of eight, and that the height must be
divisible by three. This is managed by the Resource Creator automatically, so there is no danger
of grabbing a wrongly dimensioned line.</p>

<p><b>[Grab a Box]</b><br>

Similarly, use this option to grab a group of <b>nine</b> component elements to make up a box. The
box can then be displayed using a BOx command from an Interface program. The width of this
box may be increased in steps of 24, and the height must be an exact multiple of three.</p>
