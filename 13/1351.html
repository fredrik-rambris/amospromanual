<h1>the Resource Creator</h1>

<br>

<p><b>[Exit]</b><br>
This returns you to the Main menu.</p>

<p><b>[Del]</b><br>
Use this option to delete the currently highlighted element, which will be removed from the
selection window.</p>

<p><b>[Clear]</b><br>
This erases <b>all</b> resource graphics elements from memory, and you will be asked to confirm you
decision before proceeding.</p>

<p><b>[Change Picture]</b><br>

You are allowed to change the source picture <b>without</b> changing the position of the various
elements, on condition that the new image must be <b>exactly</b> the same size as the original picture.</p>

<p><b>Editing text strings</b><br>

To end this guided tour of the Resource Creator facilities, the options provided by [Edit Text
Strings] are examined.</p>

<p>
This sub-menu allows you to enter a list of pre-defined standard messages into the Resource
Bank. These messages can then be accessed from an Interface program using the MEssage
command, or from a main AMOS Professional program, with a RESOURCE$ instruction.</p>

<p>
The Text String menu contains a large selection window that can be scrolled vertically, using the
slider bar on the right-hand side. Each item can be individually selected with the mouse, and
edited directly on the screen.</p>

<p>
The [CLEAR] button erases <b>all</b> message strings from memory, whereas [EXIT] will return you to
the Main menu.</p>

<p>Entering a new text string is extremely easy, and the following steps should be taken:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose a string to be edited from the selection window, with a single click on the <b>left</b> mouse
      button.</li>
  <li>Enter the new string definitions into memory.</li>
  <li>Repeat this procedure for all of the strings that you wish to install.</li>
  <li>Click on the [EXIT] button to return to the Main menu.</li>
  <li>Save your messages onto disc, using the [Save] or [Save As] options.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The editing of text strings takes place in an attractive dialogue box, and characters are typed
using all of the normal editing commands.</p>

<p>To save your new text into memory, press the [Return] key <b>twice</b>.</p>
