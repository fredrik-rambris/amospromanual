<h1>the Menu Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
After the menu has been edited, it may be tested by pressing the <b>right</b> mouse button. If items are
moveable, they can be repositioned freely, using the mouse New positions are retained until an
item is deleted in the current branch, or the [Reset menu position] option is chosen. In this case,
the menu will be initialised all over again.</p>

<p><b>[Add item]</b><br>
This option adds a new item at the <b>end</b> of the current menu. As a default, the new item is
assigned to the text string "EMPTY". This default status can be changed using one of many
options from the Draw menu, which appears below.</p>

<p><b>[Ins item]</b><br>
Use this option to insert a new menu item at the <b>current cursor position</b>.</p>

<p><b>[Branch]</b><br>
This is used to create a menu branch at the current cursor position, and add a new item to this
branch.</p>
<p><b>
[Delete]</b><br>
This simple option erases the selected item from the menu.</p>

<p><b>[Reset menu position]</b><br>
When this option is selected, the coordinates of all items belonging to the current menu
branch are re-set to their default positions. The message "All offsets erased!" confirms that this
has been done.</p>

<p><b>Draw menu</b><br>

This menu is extremely important. It provides the gateway to the powerful Item Drawing
Screen, which is where individual menu items are designed. When any one of the four options
is selected, the Item Drawing Screen is called, so if you are simply exploring these options, you
can click on the [previous menu] option at the bottom right-hand corner of the Item Drawing
Screen to get back to this Draw menu.</p>

<p><b>[Normal]</b><br>
This option ensures that an item in the menu will have a normal appearance setting.
[Highlighted]
When this option is chosen, the shape of the displayed item will be highlighted if it is selected
with the mouse.</p>

<p><b>[Inactive]</b><br>
After this option is triggered, an Object can be drawn which will be displayed if a selected item
has been de-activated by a MENU INACTIVE command.</p>

<p><b>[Background]</b><br>
Use this option to specify the background to be drawn behind the current item.</p>
