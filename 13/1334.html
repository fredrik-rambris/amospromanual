<h1>Disc Manager</h1>

<br>

<p>
If any of these files are recognised, you will be asked if you wish to [HEAR] them, IFF samples
will be played at their original frequency as a default, but alternative frequencies may also be
selected. Music banks will be played exactly as they were saved. When you [HEAR] a sample
bank, the samples will be played one after the other. If you prefer, any individual sample may
be selected and its playing speed can be changed. Soundtracker modules will also be recognised,
as well as most raw samples.</p>

<p>There are <b>no</b> options provided for the following sorts of files:</p>

<p>
<b>IFF music</b><br>
<b>Amiga Dos executable programs</b><br>
<b>Multiple banks</b></p>

<p><b>Formatting Discs</b><br>

AMOS Professional has been designed to cater for all of your programming needs, without ever
having to leave the system and go wandering off to much less friendly regions, like the
Workbench!</p>

<p>

Discs may be formatted at any time, via the Disc Manager. When [FORMAT] is
selected, the new disc is prepared in this logical order:</p>

<p>[NAME] is clicked on and then the name of your disc can be typed and entered.</p>

<p>
[DFx] is used to choose the name of the disc drive to be used for formatting the new disc. For
example, if you are using the internal floppy drive, select "Df0:".</p>

<p>
[VERIFY ON] or [VERIFY OFF]. To make sure that your new disc has been formatted perfectly,
it will be verified after formatting automatically. This process may be switched off if you prefer,
making disc formatting twice as fast.</p>

<p>
[FORMAT] is clicked on when everything has been set up to your liking. The entire process can
be stopped at any time, using the [ABORT] button.</p>

<p>
A disc that can be loaded and run as soon as it is inserted into a disc drive must first be installed,
otherwise a separate program will be needed to boot it. Although this can be achieved from the
Amiga's CLI, AMOS Professional is designed to keep you inside its own system, so advanced
users are provided with the [BOOTABLE] option.</p>

<p><b>Copying discs</b><br>

As well as providing you with the easiest possible disc formatting, AMOS Professional allows
you to make copies of entire discs, as many times as you like.</p>

<p>

After [DISC COPY] has been selected, the following steps are taken to make exact
copies of whole discs.</p>

<p>
First, select the name of the disc drive to be used for holding the SOURCE. Next, choose the
DESTINATION drive, where the new copies are to be made. Obviously if you only have
access to the one internal disc drive, both of these names will be the same.</p>
