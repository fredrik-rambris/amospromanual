<h1>Configuration</h1>

<br>


<p>
When the Editor configuration program is called, you can perform any required changes. The
results of the new configuration can be seen as soon as you return to the Editor.
When the [Set Editor] option is touched by the mouse pointer, a sub-menu is displayed, offering
the following selection:</p>

<p><b>[Editor Set-up]</b><br>
When this heading is selected, a simple full-screen dialogue box appears, allowing a range of
default settings to be changed. These are listed next.</p>

<p>
[Make backups of AMOS Programs?]
If set to [Yes], AMOS Professional will rename the disc file from "name.AMOS" to "name.bak",
and then save out the file as "name.AMOS"</p>

<p>
[Editor Screen Interlaced?]
Similarly, you can toggle the default setting from [No] to [Yes] and engage the interlace
function, which gives double-height resolution.</p>

<p>
[Set Editor Screen]
A new working screen is displayed, allowing you to set the position and size of the Edit
Window. Position and size buttons are available at the top of the screen, and when one of these
is triggered, the active grid can be manipulated by the mouse. Screen coordinates are displayed
automatically.</p>

<p>
Click on [Pos] to activate screen positioning, and then click somewhere in the screen grid to set
the new position. Similarly, click the [Size] button before setting the size of the screen in the
grid.</p>

<p>
An opening speed slider is also available, at the top of the screen. [Op. Speed] is used to set the
number of pixels per Vbl. For example, an opening speed screen setting of 2 pixels for a screen
height of 200 will take two seconds to open.</p>

<p>After the new settings have been made, simply click on the [Exit] button.</p>

<p>
[Maximum number of UNDO movements]
AMOS Professional will only remember (store) the number of Undo events that are specified
here.</p>

<p>
[Undo buffer maximum length (K.bytes)]
Drag the slider or click for single increments or decrements, one kilobyte at a time, ranging from
zero to 256k. If your Undo events reach this buffer limit, the first stored events will be lost.</p>

<p>
Block Undo procedures may need big chunks of memory, so don't reduce this buffer too low if
you want a decent block editing facility.</p>

<p>
[Direct Mode History, number of commands saved]
The default setting of being able to recall 20 previous Direct Mode commands
can be changed to a number from zero to 128, using the slider bar.</p>
