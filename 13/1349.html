<p>
So if you think of the Start, Middle and End components as being represented by their initial
letters, the horizontal line could be displayed in any of the following ways:</p>

<pre>
SME
SMME
SMMMMMMME
</pre>

<p><b>Vertical Line</b><br>
These are similar to their horizontal equivalents, except that vertical lines are displayed from top
to bottom rather than from left to right. So if the three components are represented as Start,
Middle and End, they would appear like this:</p>

<pre>
S
M
E
</pre>

<p><b>Box</b><br>
Boxes are simply a rectangular arrangement of the components of lines. Each box is constructed
from <b>nine</b> separate images that may be used to generate a great variety of different shapes. Look
at the following schematic diagram:</p>

<pre>
123 first line of Box
456 second line of Box
789 third line of Box
</pre>

<p>
If you remember how the Middle component of a line can be repeated, the above components
could be reconstructed to create a Box like this:</p>

<pre>
1223
4556
4556
4556
7889
</pre>

<p><b>Creating an Object</b><br>

When you click on the name of an object in the selection window, it becomes highlighted. A
flashing panel will now appear over the image of the highlighted object on the screen.</p>

<p>
When creating an object it is important to note down the various definitions. This written
reminder will be invaluable when you return to AMOS Professional and try to use the new
objects in a real Interface program!</p>

<p>Here are the options for creating an object:</p>
