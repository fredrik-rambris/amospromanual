<h1>the Object Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
The colour requester acts like a colour mixing box. If the box obscures the images on display in
the Edit or Zoom Windows, it can be moved around the screen by clicking on the top bar and
dragging, to reveal the images beneath. Look at the colour requester box now.</p>

<p>
On the left there is a stack of sixteen values for colour saturation, given in hexadecimals from
zero up to F. To the right of this are three vertical sliding bars, one each for the Red, Green and
Blue components of each colour. On the right of the panel is a stack of four boxes, as follows:</p>

<p>[OK] is triggered when you are happy with any colour changes, and want to keep them.</p>

<p>
[UNDO] will ignore any of your current colour changes, and return the palette to whatever
values were held before your latest changes.</p>

<p>[QUIT] leaves the colour requester, and ignores any changes you may have made.</p>

<p>
Below this, there is a Colour Code Box, showing the value of the RGB components of the current
colour, in hexadecimals.</p>

<p>
The Colour Panel at the bottom right of the panel displays the colour that is currently receiving
your attention.</p>

<p><b>Mixing new colours</b><br>

To change colours in the current palette, first select one colour by moving the mouse pointer
over any of the colours in the vertical palette display at the left-hand side of the screen. Now
click inside any of the RGB slider bars and move them up and down until you are satisfied with
the new colour mix. You can then change one of the other colours in the palette, or use [OK],
[UNDO] or [QUIT], as described above.</p>

<p>
If you alter the colour that is currently used for the 'framework' outlines used within the Edit
Screen, be careful not to merge this with the background colour, and cause confusion on screen.
If this does happen, and the Edit Screen becomes difficult to view, AMOS Professional will get
you out of trouble. Although you use the left mouse button to click on colours of your choice,
you may go directly to the vertical palette display and use the <b>right</b> mouse button, and change
the colours of the Edit Screen directly.</p>

<p>
The vertical palette display may show 64 colours instead of 32 in certain modes, but only colours
ranging from zero to 31 may be changed. This is because colours 32 to 63, which are used in
Extra Half Bright Mode, automatically take the first 32 colours to create versions which are
exactly half as bright as the originals. These new colours will only change when their "original"
neighbours are changed.</p>

<p><b>Screen Resolution</b><br>

<img alt="Resolution Icon"
     src="../images/1317res.jpg" align="left" />

This is the menu which controls the screen colour resolutions. It defines the number of
colours used by Object images, which may have to be adjusted to suit various screen
formats. To see how powerful it is, have some high-definition IFF images displayed in
the Edit Window, before you start experimenting.</p>
