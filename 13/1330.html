<h1>Disc Manager</h1>

<br>

<p>The AMOS Professional Disc Manager is a highly efficient and extremely fast tool for the
professional organisation of all the files on your discs. It is ideal for programmers who have
upgraded to an extra disc drive, and single-drive users will also find it beneficial. The Disc
Manager is used to reorganise all files from a SOURCE disc to a DESTINATION disc.</p>

<p><b>Calling Disc Manager</b><br>
Disc Manager is summoned from the User Menu by selecting the [Disc Manager] option.</p>

<p>Here is a view of the Disc Manager screen.</p>

<div align="center">

</div>

<p>
The screen has two main display zones, clearly headed SOURCE and DESTINATION, with all
the Disc Manager control buttons stacked between these two zones. The zone that is currently
active has its path name highlighted by a red bar, and information about this active path is
displayed in an information line at the bottom of the screen. If a path name is not valid then
nothing is displayed in the information line. As usual, all buttons and sliders are controlled
using the mouse.</p>

<p>
Click on either the [SOURCE] or [DESTINATION] headings to select one of these zones, or click
anywhere in either of the large window areas that display a list of the available directories.</p>
