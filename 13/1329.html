<h1>the Menu Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
Fill patterns are selected by clicking on the [-] and [ +] buttons, and the current pattern is
displayed in the Pattern Window at the left-hand end of the Font Window. If the Object bank is
loaded, click on [-] to assign an Object image to the current fill pattern.</p>

<p><b>[Outline]</b><br>
This option is used to add an outline to the current fill pattern.</p>

<p><b>[S. Font]</b><br>
As soon as this option is selected, the available fonts are loaded from the program disc, and a list
appears for selection. You can now choose a new typeface for the menu text, and the current
selection is shown in the Font Window.</p>

<p><b>Object</b><br>

This is the menu which controls the menu items, and it offers the following options:</p>

<p><b>[-]</b><br>
Click on these options to select which element is to be defined on screen. A picture of the item
will be displayed in the Current Item Window.</p>

<p><b>[Ins]</b><br>
Use this option to insert a new graphic element at the current position. All subsequent elements
will be shunted down one place, and if a 20th item exists, it will fall off the end of the list and be
permanently lost!</p>

<p><b>[Del]</b><br>
This option is used to delete the currently selected element.</p>

<p><b>[Push]</b><br>
An element can be saved into a <b>temporary</b> memory area, by using this option for the current
menu item. Please see the [Past] option below.</p>

<p><b>[Past]</b><br>
This is used to copy an image from memory into the current element. The data must have been
previously stored using the [Push] option.</p>

<p><b>Misc</b></p>

<p><b>[Push ltm]</b><br>
Similarly to the last option, [Push Itm] saves an entire item into a <b>temporary</b> memory area,
allowing multiple copies of suitable Objects to be made.</p>

<p><b>[Paste Itm]</b><br>
This is used to replace the current item with the contents of the temporary memory area filled
by the last [Push Itm] command.</p>

<p><b>[Load a memory bank]</b><br>
When this option is triggered, a chooser menu is displayed, allowing a set of Objects t
o be loaded from disc. After the Object bank has been installed, the new palette
is copied into the background screen automatically.</p>
