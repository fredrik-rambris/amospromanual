<h1>the Menu Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>Here is a list of the drawing options:</p>

<p><b>[Line]</b><br>
This draws a single straight line in the current ink colour.</p>

<p><b>[Box]</b><br>
A hollow rectangle is drawn by clicking on the position for one corner, and then holding and
dragging to set the position of the diagonally opposite corner.</p>

<p><b>[Bar]</b><br>
This draws a bar filled with the current fill pattern, displayed in the small Pattern Window. The
pattern can be changed with the [-] and [+] options in the Settings menu.</p>

<p><b>[Ellipse]</b><br>
Use this drawing function to create hollow ellipses or circles, in the usual way.</p>

<p><b>[Icon]</b><br>
To paste an Icon onto the menu item, an image number can be selected using the [left arrow]
and [right arrow] keys. The Icon bank must first be loaded using the [Load a memory bank]
option from the Misc: menu.</p>

<p><b>[Bob]</b><br>
This is identical in use to the [Icon] option, except that the image is taken directly from the
Object bank.</p>

<p><b>[Text]</b><br>
After the screen prompt, type in the required text via the keyboard, and it will be assigned to the
current menu element.</p>

<p><b>[T.Len]</b><br>
This is used to set the maximum length of the menu text.</p>

<p><b>[Make Inverse]</b><br>
Use this option to reverse the text and paper colours in the current element, by swapping over
their values.</p>

<p><b>[Make Border]</b><br>
This option adds a neat border around the entire element.</p>

<p><b>Settings</b><br>
The Settings menu allows the status of the various text and graphics options to be changed, as
follows:</p>

<p><b>[N] [N] [N] [-] [+]</b><br>
The three [N] icons are used to select the various text modes, with Bold, Italic and Underline
styles being shown in the Font Window, as they appear.</p>
