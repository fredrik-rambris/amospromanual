<h1>Configuration</h1>

<br>

<p>
Turning off this drive while the Amiga is operating will have <b>no</b> effect at all, because the
memory is allocated to the external drive as part of the start-up sequence.</p>

<p>
Two powerful instructions are provided that allow you to maximise the available memory for
your programs.</p>

<p><b>CLOSE WORKBENCH</b><br>
<i>instruction: close the Workbench</i><br>
Close Workbench</p>

<p>
This command closes the Workbench screen, saving about 40k of memory, and freeing it for
your own programs! Prove this now, as follows:</p>

<pre>
E> Print Chip Free, Fast free
   Close Workbench
   Print Chip Free, Fast Free
</pre>

<p>
CLOSE WORKBENCH can be executed from inside an AMOS Professional program, or from
Direct Mode, but it will not work if there is a CLI window opened. To solve this problem, ensure
that AMOS Professional loads using the following CLI instruction:</p>

<p><b>CLOSE EDITOR</b><br>
<i>instruction: close the AMOS Professional Editor Window</i><br>
<b>Close Editor</b></p>

<p>
To save more than 28k of memory, use the CLOSE EDITOR command in an AMOS Professional
program. The program listing will be completely unaffected. If there is insufficient memory to
re-open the Editor Window after the program has finished, AMOS Professional will
automatically erase the current display and revert to the standard default screen. Simply press
[Esc] to summon up the Editor as usual!</p>
