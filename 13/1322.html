<h1>the Object Editor</h1>

<br>

<p><b>VERTICAL FLIP</b><br>

<img alt="Vertical flip button"
     src="../images/1322vflip.jpg" align="left" />

One click will cause an instant flip over the vertical axis of the Object image, and another
click will flip it again. This technique works equally well on graphic blocks.</p>

<p><b>HORIZONTAL FLIP</b><br>

<img alt="Horizontal flip button"
     src="../images/1322hflip.jpg" align="left" />

This is very similar to the last option, and reverses the image around its own horizontal
axis.</p>

<p><b>ROTATE</b><br>

<img alt="Rotate button"
     src="../images/1322rotate.jpg" align="left" />

This is used to rotate the entire Object image through ninety degrees clockwise. It takes a
few seconds to compute the new image, and can be used again to keep the rotation going,
all the way back to the original image.</p>

<p>The next pair of options is provided to help you get a better view of your work.</p>

<p><b>GRAB</b><br>

<img alt="Grab button"
     src="../images/1322grab.jpg" align="left" />

If an image is too large to fit inside the Edit Window, select this icon and then use the
mouse to drag the image into view.</p>

<p><b>ZOOM</b><br>

<img alt="Zoom button"
     src="../images/1322zoom.jpg" align="left" />

Click on this icon to double the size of the graphics in the Zoom Window to four times the
size of the original image. Click it again to return to an image twice the size of the original.
Remember that the relative sizes of the Zoom and Edit Screens can be adjusted by dragging the
central Screen Sizer bar to suit your needs.</p>

<p>The final group of three options each perform general tasks.</p>

<p><b>BACKGROUND FRAMEWORK</b><br>

<img alt="Framework button"
     src="../images/1322frame.jpg" align="left" />

Every click on this icon selects the next colour in the palette for use with the framework
graphics of the Edit Screen.</p>

<p><b>MODE</b><br>

<img alt="Mode button"
     src="../images/1322mode.jpg" align="left" />

This up/down toggle sets the mode for certain drawing operations. <b>Up</b> gives Mode I,
where an Object is drawn as soon as you release a mouse button. <b>Down</b> selects Mode 2,
where you set the shape of a brush before using it for drawing.</p>

<p><b>UNDO</b><br>

<img alt="Undo button"
     src="../images/1322undo.jpg" align="left" />

This is the fail-safe icon, allowing you to scrap the last drawing procedure, or cancel a
[CLEAR] operation.</p>

<p>
Pressing the [Spacebar] key will select the <b>last</b> drawing tool that was used. This is a short-cut,
allowing you to re-use an item without the need to go through the menu process.</p>

<p><b>Memory Alerts</b><br>
Because Objects can nibble away at available memory, and because graphic screens consume
large amounts, a low-memory alert system is built into the Object Editor.
These alert messages will appear to help you automatically.</p>
