<h1>Configuration</h1>

<br>

<p>
Section 13 of this User Guide is devoted to AMOS Professional Accessories. This Chapter
explains how to manipulate the Configuration files to change the default settings of AMOS
Professional itself. The other Chapters in this Section each deal with a specific accessory
program, allowing the editing, creation or management of various AMOS Professional features.</p>

<p>
Accessories are special utility programs that can be called up "over" another program that is
being edited or tested, without disrupting anything that is "underneath". Any memory banks
that are employed by the accessory program are totally independent of the main program.
Existing data can be loaded from memory, disc or "grabbed" directly from other programs.
Please see the BGRAB command, and the associated techniques as explained in <a href="../5/577.html">Chapter 5.9</a>.</p>

<p>
When accessory programs are displayed over the current program screen, any music is
suspended, and Objects are automatically removed from the screen. Your accessory program
should check the suitability of the current screen during its initialisation, using the various
SCREEN functions, or use the DEFAULT command to erase the existing screens altogether.</p>

<p>
The IFF Picture Compactor accessory is detailed in <a href="../6/614.html">Chapter 6.2</a>, the Font Editor accessory is
examined in <a href="../11/1101.html">Chapter 11.1</a>, and the following Chapters cover the Object Editor, the Menu
Editor, the Disc Manager, the AMAL Editor, the Sample Bank Maker and the Resource Creator,
in that order.</p>

<p>
The use of the [AMOS] main menu, regarding loaded accessory programs is explained in
<a href="../4/401.html">Chapter 4.1</a>.</p>

<p><b>Defining a new accessory</b><br>

Additional Editor accessory programs can be defined, provided that the program to be defined
as an accessory is a hidden program (with no window from the Editor), and that the program is
called from the Editor via the [AMOS] main menu or via a "Program to Menu" operation.</p>

<p>
<i>SET ACCESSORY</i><br>
<i>instruction: define an accessory program</i><br>
<b>Set Accessory</b></p>

<p>
A program becomes an accessory by the simple inclusion of a SET ACCESSORY command in its
listing, preferably immediately after a SET BUFFER instruction. The new accessory has the
ability to communicate with the Editor, using the following two instructions.</p>

<p>
<b>CALL EDITOR</b><br>
<i>instruction: send instructions to the Editor from an accessory program</i><br>
<b>Call Editor</b> function<br>
<b>Call Editor</b> function,parameter,parameter$</p>

<p>
Use this command to send instructions to the Editor. The function parameter refers to a special
number, which is understood by the Editor to refer to a particular function. A list of all available
functions, along with their code numbers, is featured in the [Editor] Help menu.</p>
