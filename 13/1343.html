<h1>the Sample Bank Maker</h1>

<br>

<p>
The whole purpose of AMOS Professional accessories is to make all aspects of computer
programming as simple and friendly as possible, while saving the user the time, effort and cost
of having to go outside of the system.</p>

<p>
A ready-made recording studio is provided for creating your own customised sample banks,
and it can be loaded from the "Accessories" disc now:</p>

<pre>
LD> Load "AMOSPro_Accessories:Sample_Bank_Maker.AMOS"
</pre>

<p><b>The Sample Bank Maker screen</b><br>

A typical working screen is shown below, and all of its features can be easily identified in the
short guided tour that follows.</p>

<div align="center">

</div>


<p><b>The Current Sample window</b><br>

The top of the screen is divided into two areas. The left-hand side holds the window which is
used to display the current sample being worked on, in the form of a visual "wave pattern". You
can load an example and view it in a moment. "Silence" is represented as a straight horizontal
line in the middle of this Current Sample Window. The various frequencies that make up the
sound of the current sample are displayed as jagged patterns of vertical lines, running left to the
right, from the beginning to the end of the sample. As the sample is "played", you can see how
the wave pattern corresponds to what is heard. Above the Current Sample Window is a
horizontal display panel, which will show the name of the current sample, along with its length,
in bytes.</p>
