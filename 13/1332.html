<h1>Disc Manager</h1>

<br>

<p>

<img alt="Size button"
     src="../images/1332size.jpg" align="top" />

Files are displayed by name, followed by their length, in bytes. If you wish to turn off the
display of their lengths, for example if the file names are too long, the [SIZE] button acts
as a switch, turning them off and on. Even if a file name is shortened in the display, names of up
to 64 characters long are still valid.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Flip button"
     src="../images/1332flip.jpg" align="top" />

The [FLIP] button performs a major task! It flips over both directories, so that the Source
becomes the Destination, and the old Destination directory becomes the new Source. If
you use it now, you will note that the active path stays active after a "flip".</p>

<p>

<img alt="Credits button"
     src="../images/1332credits.jpg" align="top" />

Pressing the information button [???] will display the AMOS Professional Disc Manager
credits.</p>

<p><b>Copying files</b><br>

The Disc Manager can handle any AMOS Professional files with the greatest of ease, as well as a
range of other audio and text files. To copy one or more files or directories, first go to the Source
directory and select one or more file names that interest you. Remember, if the files you want to
copy are currently displayed in the Destination directory, use the [FLIP] button to swap them
into your Source directory.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Copy button"
     src="../images/1332copy.jpg" align="top" />

Now click on the [COPY] button. The Disc Manager will tell you exactly how many
files and directories are to be copied, and it will also calculate if there is enough
space available in the Destination directory.</p>

<p>
It does not take into account any space that might be saved by files that you wish to overwrite!
Also note that a Ram disc grabs memory when it needs space, so you can ignore any reports on
available disc space in this case.</p>

<p>
Pressing [COPY] again will kick off the copying process. The Disc Manager will create any
directories needed on the destination disc and then load up as many files as it can from the
Source disc, into the computer's memory, before saving them on the Destination disc.</p>

<p>
If you are using more than one disc drive, the process is incredibly easy. For those of you
restricted to the internal floppy disc drive "Df0:", your screen will tell you when to swap over
your discs.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Rename button"
     src="../images/1332rename.jpg" align="top" />

The Disc Manager is not just concerned with copying files from one disc to another.
It can perform much simpler tasks. Suppose you want to change the names of one
or more files. Select the appropriate files using the mouse, and then click on the [RENAME]
button.</p>

<p>
You will be asked to type in and enter the new file names, one by one, through the selected list.
Press the [Esc] key to halt this process at any time.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Delete button"
     src="../images/1332del.jpg" align="top" />

To erase one or more files from the current disc, select their names in the usual way
and then click on [DELETE]. A menu will appear, showing the files and directories
to be deleted. You now have the following choices:</p>

<p>[DELETE] erases the next file only.</p>
<p>[SKIP] jumps over the next file, leaving it on the disc.</p>
