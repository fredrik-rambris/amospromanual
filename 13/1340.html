<h1>the AMAL Editor</h1>

<br>

<p><b>[Save AMAL bank]</b><br>
The current bank will be saved to an appropriate disc, whose directory is read into the File
Selector on screen.</p>

<p><b>[Save As]</b><br>
To change the name of the current AMAL bank before saving to disc, use this option.</p>

<p><b>The Option Menu</b><br>

This simple menu is employed to control the SYNCHRO facility, used to bypass the limitations
of the Amiga's, interrupt system. If you need reminding of how this works, please refer to the
SYNCHRO ON and SYNCHRO OFF section in <a href="../7/748.html">Chapter 7.6</a> of this User Guide.</p>

<p><b>[Synchro On]</b><br>
This option is toggled with the [SYNCHRO OFF] setting, when triggered by the right mouse
button.</p>

<p><b>[Set Period]</b><br>
This allows the period between each SYNCHRO to be set for all AMAL programs, and is
prompted by on-screen instructions.</p>

<p><b>[Set Selected]</b><br>
This works as above, but only affects the highlighted selection of AMAL programs.</p>

<p><b>The Block Menu</b><br>

The last of the five menus in the AMAL Editor is a straightforward utility for manipulating
blocks of your AMAL string, rapidly and simply. As with the Blocks menu available from the
AMOS Professional Edit Screen, the start and end positions of the block are first marked, and
then manipulated by cutting, pasting, hiding or printing. Here is the Block Menu layout:</p>

<p>
<b>[Block Start]</b> or <b>[F6]</b><br>
<b>[Block End]</b> or <b>[F7]</b><br>
<b>[Block Hide]</b> or <b>[F8]</b><br>
<b>[Block Cut]</b> or <b>[F9]</b><br>
<b>[Block Paste]</b> or <b>[F10]</b><br>
<b>[Block Print]</b><br>
<b>[String Print]</b></p>

<p><b>The Environment Generator</b><br>

The vast majority of AMAL routines will normally need initialisation from the main AMOS
Professional program. To make operations more convenient, the AMAL Editor includes a
stripped-down version of the AMOS Professional interpreter called the Environment Generator.
This allows you to perform all of the initialisation routines directly from the AMAL Editor,
without the need to return to the main AMOS Professional program.</p>

<p>
A program written with the Environment Generator can be entered from the AMAL Editor
exactly as if it is a normal AMOS Professional program, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click on the EE (Environment Editor) option in the selection window.</li>
  <li>Type in the program from the keyboard, and it will be saved as part of
      the current memory bank automatically.</li>
</ul>
