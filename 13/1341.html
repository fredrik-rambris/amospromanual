<h1>the AMAL Editor</h1>

<br>

<ul>
  <li>The program will now be executed whenever an AMAL program is run from the Editor.</li>
  <li>Please note that if you want to call AMAL routines from the main AMOS Professional
      program, the Environment commands that are listed below must first be converted into
      normal AMOS Professional commands, and the appropriate lines added at the start of this
      code. Also note that if Bobs are being used, a SCREEN instruction must be used to direct the
      output to your own screen, otherwise the Bobs will be drawn to the default AMAL Editor
      screen number 7.
</ul>

<p>
These AMAL Editor commands are similar to their AMOS Professional equivalents, except for
the fact that they have been simplified to save memory. Here is a full list of commands that can
be used by the AMAL Editor system:</p>
