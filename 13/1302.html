<h1>Configuration</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>ASK EDITOR</b><br>
<i>instruction: return parameters from the Editor to an accessory program</i><br>
<b>Ask Editor</b> function<br>
<b>Ask Editor</b> function,parameter,parameter$</p>

ASK EDITOR returns parameters from the Editor, including actual lines from the program
listing! This means that source code that is currently being edited can be examined. Please refer
to the Procedure List example on Productivity disc 2 for more details.

<p><b>AMOS Professional Configuration Files</b><br>
AMOS Professional can be tailored to suit your own needs and preferences. There are two
configuration files which make this possible:</p>

<p><b>AMOSPro.Interpreter_Config</b><br>

The Interpreter configuration file relates to a large selection of features, such as the maximum
number of Bobs, copper lists, the File Selector, and so on. Hard disc and floppy disc users must
ensure that it is located in the S: folder, ensuring that the main configuration file can be found
anywhere in the system.</p>

<p><b>AMOSPro.Editor_Config</b><br>
The Editor configuration file concerns the appearance and contents of screens, menus and
messages.</p>

<p>
There are two programs available to set these configurations, appropriately named
"Interpreter_Config.AMOS" and "Editor_Config.AMOS". The Interpreter configuration program
is stand-alone, and can be loaded and run independently, or called automatically via the [Set
Interpreter] option in the [Config] menu. The Editor configuration program can only be called
from the [Config] sub-menu.</p>

<p>
Before continuing, be warned that making random changes to the AMOS Professional
configurations can be a dangerous pass-time. Be sure you fully understand the implications of
changing the default settings before experimenting. In actual fact, changing the configuration is
quite simple and straightforward.</p>

<p>
The options in the [Config] menu were outlined in <a href="../4/401.html">Chapter 4.1</a>. All of the configuration settings
available via the [Set Editor] and [Set Interpreter] options will now be examined in detail.</p>

<p><b>Setting the Editor configuration</b><br>

From the main [Config] menu, select the [Set Editor] option. The Editor_Config.AMOS program
can only be called from this sub-menu option, and a requester will be displayed if you attempt
to run it independently.</p>

<p>
All loading and saving of the Editor configuration must be performed under the control of the
Editor, because the Editor configuration program only affects the configuration within the
Editor's data zone.</p>
