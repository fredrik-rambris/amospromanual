<h1>Disc Manager</h1>

<br>

<p>
[DEL ALL] erases all the selected files, so take care when using this powerful option. You can
halt the deleting process with a click of the mouse button.
[ABORT] stops the deleting process, and returns you to the Disc Manager screen.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Make Dir button"
     src="../images/1333mkdir.jpg" align="top" />

This is a very simple way of making a new directory. Click on [MAKE DIR] and
then type in the name of the new directory to be created.</p>

<p>

<img alt="How big button"
     src="../images/1333howbig.jpg" align="top" />

To find out the size of files and directories, select their names as usual and click on
the [HOW BIG?] button. You will be told exactly how big the selected files and
directories are, in total bytes.</p>

<p><b>Examining files</b><br>

The AMOS Professional Disc Manager has been designed to provide the maximum possible
service with the greatest possible ease. The Manager can be used to examine a whole range of
different files and then provide you with the opportunity to examine them for yourself.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Examine button"
     src="../images/1333examine.jpg" align="top" />

Select as many files as you wish, and click on [EXAMINE]. AMOS Professional will
now look at each of these files in turn and see what category they fall into. It
achieves this by loading part of each file, and as soon as it is recognised, one of four options is
presented, at your service.</p>

<p>
Depending on what type of files are being examined, you will be able to [DISPLAY], [HEAR],
[READ] or [PRINT] them!</p>

<p>
In this way, the Disc Manager lets you examine the contents of your discs very quickly, while
reorganising them or simply browsing through. Here is a list of the various files that will be
recognised.</p>

<p>
<b>IFF pictures</b><br>
<b>AMOS Professional packed pictures</b><br>
When these sorts of pictures are recognised, you are given the option to [DISPLAY] them. The
displayed picture will remain on the screen until you press a mouse button.</p>

<p><b>Object Banks</b><br>
If you choose to [DISPLAY] an Object bank on the screen, it will appear in reduced size,
reminding you of all the images stored in that bank.</p>

<p><b>Ascii text files</b><br>
Two choices are offered here. You may either [READ] a text that has been saved in this format,
or [PRINT] out the file.</p>

<p>
<b>IFF samples</b><br>
<b>AMOS Professional music banks</b><br>
<b>AMOS Professional sample banks</b><br>
<b><i>Soundtracker</i> modules</b><br>
<b>MED modules</b></p>
