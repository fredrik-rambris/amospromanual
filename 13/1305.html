<h1>Configuration</h1>

<br>

<p><b>[Save Configuration]</b><br>
This saves the current configuration settings onto the program disc. These settings will be
installed in memory whenever AMOS Professional is loaded. Never change the configuration of
your original AMOSPro_System disc!</p>

<p><b>[Save Configuration As]</b><br>
Use this option to store the new configuration settings as a separate file, leaving the current
configuration unchanged.</p>

<p><b>[Set Loaded Extensions]</b><br>
Whenever a new extension file is added to the system, AMOS Professional must be informed of
its exact location on the disc. This is achieved via the extension list, and you should move the
cursor over the appropriate position, and click on the left mouse button. Enter the path and file
names of the extension from the keyboard, and press [Return].</p>

<p><b>[Set System Configuration Page 1]</b><br>
When this option or the following [Set System Configuration Page 2] option is selected, a
selection of configuration features is presented, ready to be set to your own preferences.</p>

<p>[Printer]<br>
This offers a simple toggle to disable the default setting of a carriage return with a line feed.</p>

<p>
[Close Workbench on loading]<br>
This option tells AMOS Professional to attempt to close the Workbench after it is loaded. Please
see CLOSE WORKBENCH and CLOSE EDITOR below.</p>

<p>
[Allow "Close Workbench" to work]<br>
If this setting is toggled to [No], then the CLOSE WORKBENCH command will have no effect in
a program. If there is sufficient available memory, you can prevent programs from affecting
your Workbench in this way.</p>

<p>
[Allow "Close Editor" to work]<br>
Similarly, the CLOSE EDITOR command can be permitted or made ineffective. CLOSE EDITOR
will only close the main Editor screens and remove the immediate editing buffers, gaining about
64k of memory.</p>

<p>
[Allow "Kill Editor" to work]<br>
The KILL EDITOR command is explained at the beginning of <a href="../14/1417.html">Appendix B</a>, and it is used to
remove the entire Editor. This frees up the whole of the memory space allocated to the Editor,
which is re-loaded when the program is over.</p>

<p>
[Save Icons]<br>
If set to [Yes], "info" files will be saved along with any program saved via the [Project] menu.</p>

<p>
[File Selector: Sort, Files?]<br>
If set to [Yes], files will be sorted as they are read from the current path name.</p>

<p>
[File Selector: Display File Size?]<br>
The size of files can be removed from the File Selector display, revealing</p>
