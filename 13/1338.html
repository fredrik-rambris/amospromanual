<h1>the AMAL Editor</h1>

<br>

<p><b>[Run Selected] or [F3]</b><br>
This performs the same task as [Run Current] or [F2], but instead of the current single program,
the highlighted program in the Selection Window will be run.</p>

<p><b>[Monitor] or [F4] The AMAL Monitor</b><br>
As soon as this option is selected, a new screen is displayed featuring all of the AMAL Monitor
options. This monitoring device allows you to step through your program one instruction at a
time. At the top of the Monitor screen there is a selection window, showing the list of currently
active programs. All of these programs will be executed simultaneously, so you must de-activate
any that you are not immediately interested in. Click on any of these, to turn off the highlight
selection.</p>

<p>
Because all of the AMAL registers can be accessed directly from this screen, it is very simple to
isolate any errors and cure them. All options are selected by clicking on the screen, or by
pressing the associated key. To cancel a selection, simply press the [Esc] key. Here are the
operating steps for using the AMAL Monitor:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Initialise</b>. Before using any of the Monitor options, press [I] or click on [Init screen and
      AMAL], which is the initialisation option at the top of the right-hand option stack. This runs
      the environment routine and prepares the Monitor for use.</li>
  <li><b>External Registers</b>. On the left of the Monitor window there are two vertical displays,
      showing all 26 of the external registers, from RA to RZ. These can be changed at any time by
      clicking on the chosen register with the left mouse button, then entering a new value in
      hexadecimal.</li>
  <li><b>Internal Registers</b>. The central panel displays the internal registers in the format R(channel
      number,register number). Each AMAL program has its own individual set of internal registers,
      and they can be examined by clicking on one of the direction-arrow icons underneath the
      Internal register display panel, to display R(0,0) up to R(15,9). To set a register, highlight it
      with the left mouse button, and enter a new hexadecimal value from the keyboard.</li>
  <li><b>Option Panel</b>. You may test your routine by selecting any of the other options in the right-
      hand panel, once the system has been initialised. These are self-explanatory, as follows:
</ul>


<pre>
[R] or [Run until key press]
[G] or [Go until Reg=Value]
[S] or [Perform one step]
[Esc] or [Quit Monitor]
</pre>

<p>
We will now examine the final option in the [Edit] menu, which is to be found below the
[Monitor] option.</p>

<p><b>[Play Editor] or [F5]</b><br>
Two sub-menus are offered here, [Back to String Editor Esc] will take you straight back to the
main String Editor Window. The alternative option allows you to exploit some AMAL magic!
This [Movement] menu is explained next.</p>

<p><b>[Movement]</b><br>
Here are the options available from this sub-menu, from top to bottom:</p>
