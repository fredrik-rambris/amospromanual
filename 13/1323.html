<h1>the Menu Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
The AMOS Professional Menu Editor allows you to adapt and design your own menus simply
and rapidly, using the mouse! All the advantages and features of AMOS Professional menus are
fully explained in <a href="../6/638.html">Chapter 6.5</a>.</p>

<p>
The menu system is not only extremely comprehensive, it is also very powerful. Menus can be
saved onto disc as a memory bank, and this bank can then be loaded into an AMOS Professional
program, allowing the entire menu to be accessed with a single command.</p>

<p><b>Loading the Menu Editor accessory</b><br>

Please load "Menu_Editor.AMOS" from your Accessories disc. The Main Menu appears in the
lower part of the screen as soon as the Menu Editor is loaded.</p>

<p>
All operations are performed by clicking on options with the <b>left</b> mouse button, unless
instructed otherwise. On-screen instructions and dialogue comments will appear at every stage
of operating the Menu Editor, to help and guide you.</p>

<p><b>The Main Menu</b><br>

The Main Menu displays seven simple options that are used for loading, saving and initialising
your menus, as follows:</p>

<p><b>[Create a new menu]</b><br>
This option is used to define a new screen to be used as the menu background. The screen's
default status is displayed, and this current format can be changed by clicking on the new
number of colours and the screen resolution, using the left mouse button. You can then proceed
to the Main Editing Window by selecting [Edit it], or choose the [Prey, menu] option instead,
which will call up the previous menu.</p>

<p><b>[Edit current menu]</b><br>
This calls up the Main Editor Screen, which is detailed below, and the currently selected menu is
initialised.</p>

<p><b>[Save menu bank]</b><br>
As soon as this option is triggered, the File Selector is called up. A memory bank can now be
created for your menus, and saved to disc. This menu can be loaded into an AMOS Professional
program be means of a line like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Load "Filename.Abk"
</pre>

<p>The new menu can then be initialised with this:</p>

<pre>
X> Bank To Menu 6
</pre>

<p>
The menu can now be activated by a MENU ON command. These menu banks are permanent,
and they will be saved along with the relevant program automatically. This means that once a
menu has been installed, and the menu handler has been included in your program, it will look
after itself.</p>
