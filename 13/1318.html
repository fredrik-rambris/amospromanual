<h1>the Object Editor</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Adjust</b><br>

This is a very powerful option. If it is <b>on</b>, any Object taken from the bank will
change the current palette to its own resolution preference. If the option is off, the
number of colours remains unchanged.</p>

<p>
This can have one of two effects. Either the Object has <b>less</b> colours than your current screen, 
and nothing is lost. Alternatively, if the Object has <b>more</b> colours than the current screen, 
then the higher value colours are lost. The bank will remain unchanged until the Object is 
deposited into it again. This [ADJUST] option is normally <b>on</b>.</p>

<p><b>Hi-Res</b><br>

<IMG alt="High Resolution Icon"

This is also an on/off switch, which selects the current screen mode, with the 
maximum number of colours in high resolution being 16. Everything else in the 
program remains unchanged, except for these colour resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Number of Colours</b><br>

<IMG alt="No. Colours Icon"
     src="../images/1318numcolours.jpg" align=left >

A choice of six options is available, instantly selecting the number of colours displayed
on the Edit Screen, as follows: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64.</p>

<p><b>Animation</b><br>

AMOS Professional allows you to test an animated movie sequence of the Object images
which are currently loaded. This is extremely useful, as well as very entertaining.</p>

<p>You can test the system now, using the Objects in this file:</p>

<pre>
"AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Play_Bobs.Abk"
</pre>

<p>
When the [Animation] icon is selected, the Edit Screen gives way to your own animation suite!.A 
diagram of this facility is shown below.</p>
