<h1>Disc Manager</h1>

<br>

<p>
Now choose the number of new copies you want to make of the original Source disc. The Disc Manager will ask for a new Destination disc after each copy has been made, until all of you
copies have been completed.</p>

<p>
Select [VERIFY ON] or [VERIFY OFF], as explained above, for the formatting process. If the
verification is on, the copying process will take twice as long as copying with verification set
to off.</p>

<p>
Finally, hit the [DISC COPY] button, and follow the screen prompts. You will be pleased to learn
that the AMOS Professional Disc Manager crunches down the disc tracks into the computer's
memory, to try and save you the time and effort of swapping over discs more than is absolutely
necessary.</p>

When you have finished exploiting the AMOS Professional Disc Manager, and you
are ready to move on, simply use the [QUIT] button, at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>
Remember that directories can also be changed when editing your programs, allowing you to
set directories from Direct mode.</p>


<p>
<b>DIR$</b><br>
<i>reserved variable: change current directory</i><br>
s$=<b>Dir$</b><br>
<b>Dir$</b>=s$</p>


<p>
As explained in Chapter 10.2, DIR$ can hold the directory name that is to be used as the starting
point for further disc operations, like this:</p>

<pre>
E> Dir$="Df0:Sounds/"
   Print Dir$
</pre>
