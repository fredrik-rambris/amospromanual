<h1>the Menu Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
If you click with the <b>right</b> mouse button to test the menu that is currently being edited, you can
compare this display with the menu line that it actually represents!</p>

<p><b>The Editor Menu</b><br>

Here is a short guided tour through all of the options on offer in the Editor Menu, which
occupies the bottom section of the Main Editor Window.</p>

<p>
This Editor Menu contains all of the commands needed to define the physical structure of a
menu. All of these options are performed on the <b>current</b> menu item, which is selected from the
Edit Window by clicking with the left mouse button. The current menu item is highlighted in
reverse video.</p>

<p>
All menu options are toggle operations, with alternative options selected by each mouse click.
There are three groups of options, which are from left to right, the Item status menu, the Tree
editor menu and the Draw menu.</p>

<p><b>Item status</b><br>

The Item status Menu options are used to change the status of the currently selected menu item,
as follows:</p>

<p><b>[Active] / [Inact]</b><br>
This option toggles the status of the current menu item between being active and inactive. Only
active items can be selected from the finished menu.</p>

<p><b>[Line] / [Bar] / [T.line]</b><br>
This selection affects the <b>whole branch</b> of the menu, not just the current item, and it is used to
specify the form of the branch as either a Line, a Bar or a Total Line.</p>

<p><b>[Linked] / [Separ.]</b><br>
Use this option to choose whether each item in the menu is to be linked with the one above it, or
separated. Refer to the MENU LINK command in <a href="../6/638.html">Chapter 6.5</a>, if you need reminding of this
system.</p>

<p><b>[Br.sta] / [Br.mov]</b><br>
This option also affects the <b>whole branch</b> of the menu, and is short for Branch Stationary and
Branch Moveable. It specifies whether the current menu branch can be repositioned by the user,
and is identical to the MENU MOVABLE and MENU STATIC commands.</p>

<p><b>[It.sta] / [It.mov]</b><br>
Short for Item Stationary and Item Moveable, this option toggles between whether or not items
can be individually rearranged in a menu. This is the same choice offered by the MENU ITEM
STATIC and MENU ITEM MOVABLE commands.</p>

<p><b>Tree editor</b><br>

The Tree editor menu occupies the central block of options in the Main Editor Screen. These
options allow the menu tree to be changed to new preferences, and any additions and deletions
are reflected in the main edit screen.</p>
