<h1>Disc Manager</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Entering a path name</b><br>

Path names are displayed at the top of the screen, immediately below the SOURCE and
DESTINATION headings. To enter a path name, click on the appropriate name panel, then type
in a string of characters for the path name, from the keyboard. If an empty string is entered, the
current directory name will be used as the path name. To abort this process, press [Esc].</p>

<p>
It is important to remember that the path names of your Source and Destination must be
different from one another, and it is always good practice to give each of your discs a different
name, to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>
At the inner end of each path name panel is a pair of [up arrow] and [down arrow] buttons.
These are used to scroll into view any lists of files that are too long to fit into the Source or
Destination windows. Below these buttons are normal vertical sliders, if you prefer to use them.
A continuous scroll of file names towards the mouse cursor is achieved by using the right mouse
button.</p>

<p>

You should already be familiar with the [Parent] option in the AMOS Professional File
Selector. Similarly, each path of the Disc Manager has its own Parent button, to allow
rapid access back to the parent folder, after searching through its files. To enter a sub-
directory, all that is needed is a double-click on the folder name you want to open.</p>

<p>
A "device list" is displayed by clicking with the right mouse button in the active path panel. The
available devices, that is to say the equipment for communicating with your Amiga such as disc
drives, will be listed at the top of the window zone. One more click with the right mouse button
will make the device names disappear. To select a device for use, simply click on its name with
the left mouse button.</p>

<p><b>Selecting files</b><br>

To select a file or a directory, place the mouse cursor over its name then click. De-select by
clicking again on the file or folder.</p>

<p>
The vertical stack of control buttons is used to handle your files. They will now be explained,
from top to bottom.</p>

<p>

<img alt="ALL button"
     src="../images/1331all.jpg" align="top" />

[ALL] is a short-cut button that selects all of the files listed in the active path, ready for
handling.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Clear button"
     src="../images/1331clr.jpg" align="top" />

[CLEAR] performs the opposite task to [ALL], by de-selecting all of the files in the active
path.</p>

<p>

<img alt="Info button"
     src="../images/1331info.jpg" align="top" />

There can be files on your disc that end with an "Info" tag, and the [INFO] button acts as
a switch to turn these information files off and on, in the zone window display. These
files can still be copied even if they are not currently displayed, for example, if entire discs are
being copied.</p>
