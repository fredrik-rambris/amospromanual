<h1>the Resource Creator</h1>

<br>

<p><b>[Edit Graphic Elements]</b><br>

All the components used to construct the objects on the screen are created here. These objects
can be displayed subsequently using the LIne, BOx and UNpack commands from an Interface
program. You may also use the RESOURCE UNPACK instruction from the main AMOS
Professional program. This option offers a working screen and sub-menu, which is fully
explained below.</p>

<p><b>[Edit Text Strings]</b><br>

This is used to enter the list of text strings that are to be used for the various on-screen messages.
These messages can be accessed using the MEssage function from an Interface program, or the
AMOS Professional RESOURCE$ option. A full explanation of the text editing options appears
below.</p>

<p><b>[Quit]</b><br>
This will discard the current resource bank completely, and return to AMOS Professional. If any
changes have been made, you will be asked to confirm your actions before being allowed to
quit.</p>

<p><b>Editing Graphic Elements</b><br>

Resource elements can be grabbed directly from a normal IFF screen. Any screen can be used for
this purpose, including Hires and interlace mode screens. When the [Edit Graphic Elements]
option is chosen, a selection box appears containing all of the current objects displayed on
screen, with a summary of information about each one. The format of this summary is as
follows:</p>


<pre>
Item-no            - Type             : Size
</pre>

<p>
The item-no refers to the index number of the object that has been created, the type is one of
four possible categories of object, described next, and the size of the object is given as
explained below.</p>

<p>
The four possibilities for the category of object are an element, a horizontal line, a vertical line or
a box. There follows a brief explanation of each of these types of resource objects.</p>

<p><b>Element</b><br>

This is a simple picture that can be displayed on the screen by using the UNpack command. The
width of a resource element must be at least eight pixels, and it may be increased by multiples of
eight only. The height of an element can be as tall as required.</p>

<p><b>Horizontal Line</b><br>

Resource lines are constructed by arranging a group of <b>three</b> components on screen. One
component represents the Start of the line, another the Middle and the third is for the End of
the line. Each element is made up of at least eight pixels, and since there are three different
components, the Resource Creator will only allow you to grab these lines in steps of 8*3, or 24
units wide. Obviously, only one each of the Start and End components is possible, and AMOS
Professional will repeat the Middle section of the line automatically.</p>
