<h1>the Resource Creator</h1>

<br>

<p>
The following keyboard short-cuts have been assigned to these operations, to make the editing
of text strings even faster:</p>


<pre>
<b>key         effect</b>
[Return]    Replace the existing text string at the current position by new text,
            completely erasing the original entry.
[F-1]       Insert text into a new position in the list, moving all of the existing entries
            one place down.
[Del]       Erase the current line and completely remove it from the message list.
[Esc]       Abort the operation and return to the selection window.
</pre>


<p><b>Automatic Bank grabbing</b><br>

Similarly to the Sample Bank and Object Bank editors, AMOS Professional provides an
automatic method of grabbing a bank with the Resource Creator. Supposing you are working on
a program, and you decide to create a Resource Bank. The following steps should be followed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the [Resource Ed] option from the user menu. The program will be loaded and sent to
      the command line "GRAB".</li>
  <li>The Resource Creator will grab the current program's bank automatically, and you are now
      free to modify it. If your current program has no available bank, simply create a new one or
      load a bank that has already been defined. The Resource Creator will display a "GRABBED"
      message immediately in front of the name of the bank.</li>
  <li>When you select the [QUIT] option, you will be asked if you want to copy the modified bank
      back into your edited program.</li>
  <li>On returning to the main AMOS Professional Edit screen, your modified Resource Bank will
      be in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The advantage of this automatic system is that it very fast, because it suppresses the saving of a
bank from the edited program, the need to load and save it from the Editor and then re-load it
from the edited program.</p>
