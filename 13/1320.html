<h1>the Object Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
This menu line is completely independent from the Major Options, and contains all of the
d rowing tools which can be used at any suitable time. These drawing operations only effect the
visible part of the Object image that is being edited. You are invited to tackle them now, from
left to right.</p>

<p><b>DOT PLOT</b><br>

<img alt="Single dot button"
     src="../images/1320dot.jpg" align="left" />

Click on this icon now, and experiment by clicking the mouse button in the editing
window, to plot single pixels. Then keep the button held down, and move the mouse
around at different speeds to see the different effects that can be achieved.</p>

<p>
Now try the other mouse buttons, then both buttons together to remind yourself that the top
three colours in the vertical palette refer to the left, right and combined mouse buttons. If you
have a three-button mouse, the third button will make use of the third colour automatically.</p>

<p><b>LINE PLOT</b><br>

<img alt="Continuous dot button"
     src="../images/1320line.jpg" align="left" />

This offers a continuous solid line plot. The speed of mouse movement
makes no difference at all to its usage.</p>

<p><b>DRAW</b><br>

<img alt="Draw Icon"
     src="../images/1320draw.jpg" align="left" />

Before this drawing tool can be used effectively, you should design it for yourself! First of
all, set the size and positioning of your own "line" by clicking anywhere in the Edit
Window, holding down the mouse button, dragging it and then letting go.
Now use your own shape to paint and draw with. Further along the line of drawing icons, you
will see how the [MODE] button changes certain drawing operations. If it is selected and used
with [DRAW], then lines are drawn as soon as the mouse button is released.</p>

<p><b>BOX</b><br>

<img alt="Box button"
     src="../images/1320box.jpg" align="left" />

This is an extremely simple option. Click the mouse button to set any corner of a box, keep
the button held down while the diagonally opposite corner is located, then let go. One box
appears, ready to be used as a brush, or pasted again as many times as you like, by moving the
mouse and clicking a button.</p>

<p>
Remember that a third colour is available for drawing operations, by pressing both mouse
buttons together.</p>

<p><b>ELLIPSE</b><br>

<img alt="Ellipse button"
     src="../images/1320ellipse.jpg" align="left" />

This works in exactly the same way as [BOX], except that ellipses do not have corners. Set
the boundary points of your ellipse as described above, or create circles by making the two
radii of the ellipse equal.</p>

<p><b>AIR-BRUSH</b><br>

<img alt="Air brush button"
     src="../images/1320airbrush.jpg" align="left" />

To set different spray effects, click the <b>right</b> mouse button on this icon. This will reveal a
selector menu for customising the air-brush spray can. Both the "power" of the jet and the
width of the spray nozzle can be adjusted from 1 up to 100, and the [OK] button is used to exit
from the selector to commence spraying.</p>

<p>
Experiment to see the various effects, or if you prefer to spray without customising
your own air-brush, click on the icon with the <b>left</b> mouse button.</p>
