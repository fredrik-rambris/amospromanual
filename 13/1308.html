<h1>the Object Editor</h1>

<br>

<p>
The Object Editor is a utility that enables the AMOS Professional programmer to create and edit
screen Objects such as Bobs, Hardware Sprites, Computed Sprites, Icons and Blocks. The Object
Editor allows you to change the appearance of Objects in an almost limitless way and it even
includes your own animation suite!</p>

<p><b>Loading the Object Editor</b><br>

The best way to understand the Object Editor is to go ahead and use it. It can be selected from
the User Menu by triggering the [Object Editor] option.
Alternatively, make sure that the Accessories disc is loaded and select the following program
from the File Selector:<br>

<pre>
Object_Editor.AMOS
</pre>

<p>
The Object Editor is crammed full of data. In fact it contains so many features that they cannot
all be accommodated in the amount of memory reserved for the editing buffer, if the Object
Editor is loaded using the File Selector. A message will appear in the Information Line asking if
you want to change the buffer size, and you should respond by pressing [Y] before you can run
the Object Editor.</p>

<p>
When the Object Editor has loaded, a Main Menu Screen appears. Before you go any further,
load some Object images into the Object Editor to provide something practical to work on.
Please follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at the line of boxed images at the top of the screen. In the top left-hand corner is a panel
      that says "Object Editor". Next to that is a panel displaying an icon of a disc drive. Click on
      this disc drive icon with the <b>left</b> mouse button, and leave the mouse cursor exactly where it is.</li>
  <li>A new range of images should now be displayed at the top of the screen. Using the left mouse
      button, please click on the box that shows a floppy disc with an arrow pointing to the right
      towards a "storage bank" building.</li>
  <li>A file selector should now appear, headed "Choose an Object bank". From the Tutorial disc,
      select the folder marked "*Objects", then load the "Bobs.Abk" file.</li>
  <li>The Main Menu Screen will now fill with various Object images. When this happens, move
      your mouse pointer to anywhere in the top line of images, and click on the right mouse
      button. You are now ready to experience the wonders of the AMOS Professional Object
      Editor.</li>
</ul>
