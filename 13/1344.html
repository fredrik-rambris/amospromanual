<h1>the Sample Bank Maker</h1>

<br>

<p><b>The Sample Bank Window</b><br>

The upper right-hand section of the screen is where the contents of the sample bank is
displayed. Each sample is listed with its own number, name and length in bytes. As you would
expect, a vertical slider bar and slider arrows are provided to display any parts of the contents
list that are too large to fit into the display. The name of the current sample bank is displayed at
the top of this window.</p>

<p><b>Transfer Buttons</b><br>

Between the Current Sample Window and the list of samples in the bank are two big buttons,
marked with a left-arrow and a right-arrow. These are transfer buttons used to move a sample
between the bank (represented by the top right-hand side of the screen) and the working area
(represented by the top left-hand side of the screen).</p>

<p>
This allows you to pull a sample from the bank, test it or work on it while it is in the Current
Sample Window, and then deposit it back at the selected position in the bank. If a copy of a
sample that has been worked on is positioned as the <b>last</b> item in the bank, it becomes a <b>new</b>
sample to be added at the end of the bank.</p>

<p><b>The Information Line</b><br>

A horizontal Information Line runs across the width of the screen, below the Current Sample
Window and the Sample Bank display. This reports on the current status of memory, and
provides useful messages.</p>

<p><b>The Control Panel</b><br>

The lower third of the screen is occupied by all of the control buttons that operate the Sample
Bank Maker. Please load some samples now, before they can be demonstrated.</p>

<p><b>Load Bank</b><br>

the control buttons as usual. Have your "AMOSPro_Examples" disc ready in the drive, and 
prepare to edit "Mixture.Abk" after pressing the [Load Bank] button. The numbers, names and 
lengths of all the samples in this bank should now appear in the display window.</p>

<p><b>Load current sample from bank</b><br>

<img alt="Load sample button"
     src="../images/1344loadsample.jpg" align="left" />

Now load one of the samples into the Current Sample Window, ready for testing.<br>
For example, select "Bubbler by highlighting its name with a mouse click and pressing the
[Left arrow] transfer button.
As soon as a current sample has been transferred, all of the
other control buttons become active.</p>

<p><b>Hear a sample</b><br>

<img alt="Play sample button"
     src="../images/1344play.jpg" align="left" />

If your audio system is ready, [Hear] the current sample now. See how the
frequency pattern is shown between the start and end borders of the Current
Sample Window. You are now ready to begin editing the sample.</p>
