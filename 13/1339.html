<h1>the AMAL Editor</h1>

<br>

<p><b>[Record] or [F1]</b><br>
This records a movement pattern and stores it in the AMAL memory bank. A full explanation of
recording and playing movement patterns is explained below.</p>

<p><b>[Playback] or [F2]</b><br>
Use this option to replay a pre-recorded movement pattern.</p>

<p><b>[Insert] or [F3]</b><br>
This option is used to insert a new pattern at the current position. Any patterns after this
insertion point will be shifted one place to the right, unless it is the 48th pattern in the list, in
which case it will fall off the end of the list and be lost!</p>

<p><b>[Delete] or [F4]</b><br>
Use this to erase the current movement pattern. All subsequent patterns in the list will now be
shifted one position to the left.</p>

<p><b>Recording and playing movement patterns</b></p>

<p>
The [Play Editor] option allows you to record a complex movement pattern, by repeatedly
logging the position of the mouse cursor as it is moved across the screen, and storing this
movement data in the AMAL memory bank. The movement pattern can then be used to
animate almost any Object you like! Here is the procedure for using this technique:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the [Play Editor] from the [Edit] menu. Remember that the display can be repositioned
      using the black horizontal bar.</li>
  <li>Choose the pattern number you want to define, by highlighting the appropriate item in the
      Selection Window.</li>
  <li>Call the [Record] option from the [Movement] sub-menu, and instructions will appear on
      screen regarding the current recording speed. The delay between each recorded mouse
      position is set in 50ths of a second, and the default setting offers the smoothest results.
      Alternatively, a slower setting can be used to save memory, sacrificing a degree of smoothness.</li>
      The easiest way to discover what suits you best is to experiment.</li>
  <li>Move the mouse to the start position for the proposed animation sequence, and press [Return]
      to start the recording operation.</li>
  <li>Now move the mouse at will, and the mouse cursor position will be recorded continuously at
      the sampling rate you have chosen, until you halt the process by pressing the <b>left</b> mouse
      button.</li>
  <li>Repeat the above sequences if necessary, and when you want to view the recorded animation
      pattern, select the [Play back] option from the [Movement] sub-menu.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Disc Menu</b><br>

This simple menu is called from the Information Line, using the right mouse button. It offers
three self-explanatory options, as follows:</p>

<p><b>[Load AMAL bank]</b><br>
This calls the File Selector, from which the selected AMAL bank can be loaded.</p>
