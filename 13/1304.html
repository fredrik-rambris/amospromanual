<h1>Configuration</h1>

<br>

<p>
[Set Editor Files]
This option allows you to rename system files that AMOS Professional is seeking, and should be
used with caution.</p>

<p><b>[Colour Palette]</b><br>
This option allows the default colours used by the Edit window, Direct Mode window, and so
on, to be changed.</p>

<p>
After choosing which window colours are to be affected, select the current colour to be changed
using the mouse, and use the RGB sliders to adjust colours to your own preferences.</p>

<p><b>[Menu Messages]</b><br>
Any string can be changed for any of the existing menu messages. This may be necessary if you
wish to translate the English wordings into another language, or adapt the existing menus to
your own preferences. Simply use the slider to display the range of default messages, click on
the one that is to be changed, and type in your new string of characters. The string will be set to
the correct length automatically, or spaces will be added to pad the string to fit the existing size
of the menu item.</p>

<p><b>[Dialog messages]</b><br>
Similarly, this option summons up every one of the system's dialogue messages, ready for
modification. Please see <a href="1347.html">Chapter 13.7</a> for a comprehensive guide to the Interface Resource
Editor.</p>

<p><b>[Test-Time Messages]</b></p>

<p><b>[Run-Time Messages]</b><br>
The last two options in the [Editor set-up] menu operate in exactly the same way as the [Menu
Messages] option. Error messages are examined in <a href="../12/1211.html">Chapter 12.3</a>.</p>

<p><b>Setting the Interpreter Configuration</b><br>
The stand-alone Interpreter_Config.AMOS program can be called from the [Config] main menu,
by selecting the [Set Interpreter] option. This program is an accessory, so the Edit Screen is not
erased, but remains underneath.</p>

<p>
Here is a list of the options available in the Interpreter Configuration menu, called by [Set
Interpreter].</p>

<p><b>[Load Default Configuration]</b><br>
This loads the existing configuration file from the APSystem folder, found on the
AMOSPro_System disc.</p>

<p><b>[Load Other Configuration]</b><br>
A File Selector is displayed, inviting you to choose an Interpreter_Config file. It is perfectly
acceptable to have several such files on your start-up disc. All configurations should be kept in
the APSystem folder, and assigned individual names.</p>
