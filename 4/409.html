<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P>
Please note that a maximum of 10k is needed to open the AMOS Professional File 
Selector. If memory does not allow for the File Selector to be opened, a simple <b>input line</b> will be 
displayed instead, inviting you to enter a file name. If this very rare situation happens, type in 
the name of the file you wish to load or save, and press [Return].</P>

<P>
The standard AMOS Professional File Selector features a window displaying the names of 
all the files stored on the current disc. There is a slider bar to the right of this window, as 
well as a pair of Up/Down arrows, allowing you to scroll through the file names. By using 
this slider, all available paths can be displayed, without the need to specify path names.</P>

<P>
On the right-hand side of the File Selector is a column of buttons offering the 
following facilities, from top to bottom:</P>

<P>[OK]<br>
This affirmative button informs AMOS Professional that you are satisfied with 
the current situation and dismisses the File Selector, returning you to 
the current program. It can be used to save the current program to disc, after 
you have typed in the new program name in the input line at the bottom of the File Selector. 
Whenever you click on [OK], AMOS Professional automatically sets its current 
directory to the directory of the File Selector.</P>

<P>[Cancel]<br>
Cancel your current operation by clicking on this button.</P>

<P>[Parent]<br>
Because the hierarchy of individual files can get complex, it is sometimes necessary to
negotiate a path through the current directory. A full explanation of this subject is
covered in <a href="../10/1008.html">Chapter 10.2</a>.</P>


<p>[Devices]<br>
This is used to call up a list of all devices. In other words, the available hardware
items, such as disc drives.</p>

<P>[Assigns]<br>
When this option is selected, only the current assigns are listed.</P>

<P>[Sort]<br>
If this button is in the "on" position, files will be automatically sorted when they
are read from the disc, and listed in order. The File Selector will remember the
setting of the [Sort] button when it is next called.</P>

<P>[Sizes]<br>
If this button is "on", the size of each file will be displayed. 
This setting is also remembered when the File Selector is subsequently called.</p>

<p>[Get Dir]<br>
This button re-reads the current disc directory, and can be useful if the floppy disc
has been changed.</p>
