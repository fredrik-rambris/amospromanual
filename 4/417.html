<P>[Reduce] or [Amiga]+[N8]<BR>
To reduce the bottom border of the window, use this option to position it higher by one 
screen</P>

<p style="background: black; color: white">
Macros</p>

<p>
The [Macros] menu allows a whole string of editor commands to be assigned to a single key-press.</P>


<P>[Enter a New Macro] or [Ctrl]+[M]<BR>
	
After selecting this option, you will be asked which key-press is to be allocated to the 
new Macro. This can be a single character or a combination of keys that are to be pressed 
together. Macros work by referring to the "scan code" of keys rather than the actual character 
value. This means that <b>any</b> key or combination of keys can be assigned independently, including the 
keys from the numeric keypad, providing that the following rules are obeyed:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Other Macro definitions may not be included. They will be completely ignored!</LI>

  <LI>Each Macro definition can hold up to 400 key presses.</LI>

  <LI>Menu short-cuts can only be used if they do not call up a dialogue box, so the keys 
  allocated   to [Search New] are <b>not</b> available, but the [Search Next] and [Search previous] 
  keys will work without problems.</LI>

  <LI>If your key combination has been previously assigned to a menu item, the existing 
  short-cut keys will be de-activated and the new Macro definition will take priority.</LI>

</UL>

<P>
Once a new Macro has been defined, click on a mouse button to save it into memory. To 
keep Macro definitions, they can be saved directly onto disc using the [Save Macro] option 
explained below.</P>

<P>[Delete One Macro]<BR>
Simply select the Macro to be deleted by pressing its key combination. It will then be 
deleted from memory. This memory space will now be released to the main AMOS Professional 
system.</P>

<P>[Delete All Macros]<BR>
This option is used to erase all Macro definitions in a single operation.</P>

<P>[Load Macros]<BR>
This loads a named Macro file from disc.</P>

<P>[Load Default Macros]<BR>
Use this option to load the AMOSPro.Macros file from the APSystem folder.</P>

<P>[Save Default Macros]<BR>
	
This saves all defined Macros into a special file on disc, named AMOSPro.Macros. In future,
whenever AMOS Professional is run, the saved Macros will be loaded instantly.</P>

<P>
If necessary, Macro definitions can be saved automatically, whenever you leave AMOS
Professional. This process is detailed below, under [Quit Options] in the [Config] Main 
Menu heading.</P>
