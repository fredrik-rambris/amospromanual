<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P><b>[Search Previous]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[B]</b><BR>
	
This will search backwards through the listing until an example of the target string is 
found, or the beginning of the program is reached.</P>

<P><b>[Replace New]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[F]</b><BR>
	
This replaces any string of characters or any AMOS Professional instruction with your 
given text. The dialogue box for this option contains two editing zones:</P>

<P>
The target characters that are to be located and then replaced are to be found in the 
Search string. This will be the same as any previously called [Search] operation, or a new string 
can be specified. The Replace string holds the text that will be substituted in place of the 
original characters. Click on the appropriate zone using the <b>left</b> mouse button, or flick between 
the Search and Replace strings using the [Tab] key.</P>

<P>
As well as the [Backward] and [Upper Case = Lower Case] options, two more settings 
are available when a Replace operation is chosen.</P>

<P>[All Occurrences]<BR>
	
This automatically replaces <b>every</b> instance of the target string with the new characters.
Obviously this can be a drastic operation, so you will be asked to confirm your wishes 
before they are obeyed.</P>

<P>[All in Marked Block]<BR>
This restricts the Search and Replace operation to all instances of the target characters 
within the currently highlighted Block.</P>

<P>
Once the strings have been set, a Replace operation is commenced by pressing [Return] 
or triggering the [OK] button. After a successful Replace operation, the cursor is positioned
immediately after the amended text. If the search fails, a "Not found" report will be 
given in the title line.</P>

<P><b>[Replace next]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[N]</b><BR>
	
Use this option to scan the program listing for another example of the search string. If 
this is successful, the cursor is placed immediately after the replaced text.</P>

<P><b>[Replace Previous]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[B]</b><BR>
This checks backwards through the program listing, and replaces the targeted characters 
with the replacement string entered by a [Replace New] option.</P>

Config</p>

The AMOS Professional editor can be totally re-configured, allowing you to tailor it 
precisely to your own needs and preferences. All of the keyboard assignments can be changed, all of the
system messages may be freely customised and you can even assign existing menu items
directly to your own programs and call them straight from the screen!</P>

<P>
This sort of feature allows you to use sophisticated techniques with the utmost 
simplicity, making your programming truly professional.</P>
