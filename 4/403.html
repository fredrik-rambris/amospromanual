<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>
<P>
The [WB] button will have no effect if the CLOSE WORKBENCH command has been called
from one of your programs, as explained in <a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a>.</P>

<P>
Between the [DIR] and [WB] buttons, there is a line of icons that provide rapid access to various
features, directly from the screen. From left to right, they have the following uses:</P>

<p>
<img alt="Run button"
 src="../images/402run.jpg" align="top" /> 
As usual, all of these icons are activated by the <b>left</b> mouse button. 
This is the [RUN] button, and it is used to run the current program listing. 
If any errors are encountered in the program, a message will be displayed in the Information Line.</p>


<p>
<img alt="Test button"
 src="../images/402test.jpg" align="top" /> 
 The [TEST] button instructs AMOS Professional to test the current program for errors, 
without running the program. A full list of error messages is listed in <a href="../12/1211.html">Chapter 12.3</a>, 
and the Help facility is available to explain the correct use and syntax of instructions.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Indent button"
 src="../images/402indent.jpg" align="top" /> 
 [INDENT]. Use this button to automatically indent your program listings.
  Where example programs are printed in this User Guide, they are displayed in indented format.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Monitor button"
 src="../images/402monitor.jpg" align="top" /> 	
 This icon is used to summon up the AMOS Professional [MONITOR], which provides
 detailed help and analysis of your programs. A full explanation of the Monitor can be 
 found in <a href="../12/1201.html">Chapter 12.1</a>.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Help button"
 src="../images/402help.jpg" align="top" /> 
[HELP]. The next Chapter provides a detailed examination of the AMOS 
Professional help facilities. Use this button to call up the Help main menu.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Under button"
 src="../images/402under.jpg" align="top" />

 <img alt="Above button"
 src="../images/402above.jpg" align="top" /> [UNDER] and [ABOVE]. This pair of buttons is used to display the window 
 which is under or above the current window, in other words it moves to the previous or next window.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Insert/Overwrite button"
 src="../images/402ins.jpg" align="top" /> The [INSERT/OVERWRITE] button toggles between the two modes of editing, 
 which are explained in the paragraphs concerning the Information Line, below.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Procedures button"
 src="../images/402procedures.jpg" align="top" /> The [PROCEDURES] icon is used to open or close a procedure.
 Unlike the image of the last button, which is a toggle, this icon is an animation, and after being activated 
  it returns to its original state.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Return button"
 src="../images/402return.jpg" align="top" /> This icon represents [INSERT A RETURN], and its use is dealt with in the 
explanations of the menu options.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Under button"
 src="../images/402chipfast.jpg" align="top" /> The two indicator bars to the right of the above
  icon buttons display the amount of <b>Chip</b> and <b>Fast</b> memory that is currently being used.</P>
