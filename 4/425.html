<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P><b>[Set Program to menu]</b><BR>
	
Ths option allows any menu option to be replaced with a simple call to an AMOS 
Professional program. This can be loaded from disc automatically, and executed every time the 
appropriate menu option is called. Alternatively, the program can be permanently installed in memory,
ready for instant use.</P>


<P>
If the program has been defined as an Editor Accessory with the SET ACCESSORY 
instruction, it will even be able to call up a program listing directly, and display the results on the 
Editor screen. This means that the Editor can be extended as much as you like! Please see <a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a>
for a complete explanation of this superb feature.</P>

<P>Here is the procedure for replacing a menu option with a program:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Call [Set Program to Menu] from the [Config] main menu heading.</LI>

  <LI>After the prompt, select the menu item that you want to redefine, which can be any 
  option other than the Accessory list in the [AMOS] menu.</LI>

  <LI>A standard File Selector will now appear, and is used to enter the program that is 
  to be assigned to the menu option.</LI>

  <LI>Finally, enter your selection of run options from the following items in the 
  dialogue box which appears:</LI>
</UL>

<P>[Command Line:]<BR>
	
This holds some text that will be available from the COMMAND LINE$ function when the
program is run. If this is left blank, AMOS Professional will grab all of the characters to the <b>right</b>
of the Editor cursor into the COMMAND LINE$ string. This provides a simple way of creating
your own "Help" routines.</P>

<P>The program can be loaded in one of two ways:</P>

<P>[Load As Accessory]<BR>
This will load the program as an accessory, which will not be available from the [AMOS] 
main menu heading, but will be hidden away in memory.</p>

<p>[Load in current window]<BR>
This saves the current program onto disc, and replaces it with the new menu routine.</p>

<p>[Keep After Run]<BR>
After the program has been run, there are two alternative choices as to what can 
happen:</P>

<P>[Un-ticked]<BR>
If the program was loaded as an accessory, it will be removed from memory. If it was 
entered via the current window, it will be erased and the previous program will be re-loaded automatically.</P>

<P>[Ticked]<BR>
The program will remain permanently in memory after it has been run. It will be stored as 
an accessory or directly in the current window, depending on the option that has been selected.</P>
