<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P><b>[Quit Options]</b><BR>
This menu controls what happens when you choose to quit the Editor. A large dialogue box 
is displayed, offering these possibilities:</P>

<P>[Confirm Quit]<BR>
If this option is ticked, AMOS Professional will always ask for confirmation before 
allowing you to quit.</P>

<P>[Save Configuration]<BR>
If the Editor configuration has been changed during the current editing session, these 
changes will be saved directly into the "AMOSPro.Configuration" file in the APSystem folder, 
before quitting.</P>

<P>[Save Macros]<BR>
This forces any new Macro definitions to be saved onto disc whenever AMOS Professional is quit.</P>

<P>[Auto-resume]<BR>
If this option is selected, <b>all</b> programs in memory will be stored on disc automatically, 
before allowing you to leave AMOS Professional. The next time AMOS Professional is loaded, it 
will be restored to the exact state in which it was left. This important facility allows the AMOS
Professional programmer to re-commence work at the exact point and in the exact state of 
the last working session!</P>

<P><b>[Autosave]</b><BR>
The Autosave feature provides a regular prompt to remind you that all listings are to be 
saved to disc. A dialogue box is displayed at regular intervals for each program in memory.</P>

<P>
Selecting the [YES] button saves a program to disc, under its present filename. If [NO] 
is chosen, the next program in the list is moved to.</P>

<P>
The [Autosave] option offers a choice of the delay interval between each reminder to 
save your programs, set in minutes. To turn the reminder system off, simply enter a value of zero.</P>

<P><b>[Set Editor]</b><BR>
Use this option to reveal the following sub-menu, for setting your own preferences.</P>

<P>[Setup]<BR>
The Editor set-up can be changed via the simple dialogue box presented by this option. The
AMOS Professional configuration is fully dealt with in <a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a>.</P>

<P>[Colour Palette]<BR>
The On Screen colours can be set to your desired requirements when you click on this menu item.</P>
