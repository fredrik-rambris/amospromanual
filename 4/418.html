<P>[Save Macros]<BR>
When this option is called, a file selector is opened with a request for a filename to be 
given. All Macro definitions will be saved in the chosen file onto disc. This can be used 
to create special Macro lists for particular programming tasks.</P>

<P>
While working on a very long program, a great deal of time can be wasted moving back 
and forth through the listing. The next selection of menu options is used to control up to ten
markers, which allow a specific position in the listing to be marked and saved.</P>

<P><b>[System Marks]</b><BR>
The first, second and third Marks are automatically loaded with your last three cursor 
positions, so if you move to a new label, or execute a [Search/Replace] operation, for example, you can
jump back to the previous location instantly.</P>

<P>
The Mark system works like a stack, and every time you move to a new location in the program
listing, the position of the cursor in added at the bottom of the stack, with the oldest Mark
being discarded from the top of the stack.</P>

<P>When the [System Mark] option is chosen, the following simple sub-menu is presented:</P>

<PRE>
   [Goto 1] or [Ctrl]+[N1]
   [Goto 2] or [Ctrl]+[N2]
   [Goto 3] or [Ctrl]+[N3]
</PRE>

<p>
These three options are used to jump directly to the last, second to last and third from 
last cursor positions.<p>
	
<p><b>[User Marks]</b><BR>
	
These marker points can be user-defined anywhere in the current program. The Marks are set
by holding down the [Ctrl]+[Shift] keys, and pressing a key from [4] to [9].Once a Mark 
has been set in this way, it can be jumped to by holding down the [Ctrl] key and pressing the
appropriate number key.</p>

<p>
The [User Marks] option presents two lists of Mark numbers from [4] to [9]. By 
highlighting one of these items, an additional menu is presented allowing you to [Set] or [Goto] 
the chosen Mark.</p>

<p>[Cursor Move]<BR>
	
This option is provided to show a representation of the movement keys from within the 
menu. Once you have become familiar with the various key combinations, it is probably faster to
control movements directly from the keyboard. Here are the various items in this menu:</p>

<p>[Goto Line Number] or [Amiga]+[G]<BR>
	
This is used to move the cursor directly to a specified line, and a dialogue box is 
presented ready for the line number to be entered. The lines in the listing are counted 
from the top, starting at line number one. Closed procedures are treated as a <b>single</b> line. 
Press [Return] or click on the [OK] button to jump to the specified line.</p>
