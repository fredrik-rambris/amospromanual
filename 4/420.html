<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P>[Delete Left Word] or [Shift]+[Backspace]<BR>
The word to the immediate left of the cursor is deleted by this option.</P>

<P>[Delete Right Word] or [Shift]+[Del]<BR>
This erases the word in the current line immediately to the right of the cursor.</P>

<P>[Delete to E.O.L.] or [Ctrl]+[Del]<BR>
Use this option to erase all characters from the current cursor position forwards to the 
End Of the current Line.</P>

<P>[Delete Line] or [Ctrl]+[Y]<BR>
This completely erases the current line, and the program listing scrolls upwards one line 
to fill the gap.</P>

<P>[Insert Line] or [F10]<BR>
This option is used to insert a blank line at the present position in the program 
listing.</P>

<P>[Tab Right] or [Tab]<BR>
Move the cursor right, to the next Tab setting.</P>

<P>[Tab Left] or [Shift]+[Tab]<BR>
This is used to move the cursor one position left to the previous Tab setting.</P>

<P>[Set Tab] or [Ctrl]+[Tab]<BR>
This option is used to set the distance in characters between successive Tab stops.</P>

<P><b>[Set Text Buffer]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[T]</b><BR>
This is the option which is used to change the size of the memory area assigned for 
program listings. Each window has its own separate text buffer, which can be set 
independently.</P>

<P>
A dialogue box appears, allowing a new text buffer size to be entered directly. If the 
memory allocation is increased, the new space can be used immediately from the Editor. However, 
if the new memory setting is <b>smaller</b> than the previous value, the existing contents of the window 
will be <b>lost!</b></P>

<P><b>[Undo]</b> or <b>[Control]+[U]</b><BR>
This powerful option is used to erase every character edit, movement and block operation 
that has been created in the current editing session. You simply keep calling Undo to work back
through the changes you made before calling Undo.</P>

<P>A call to CLOSE EDITOR or the running of a program will clear all the Undo memory store.</P>

<P><b>[Redo]</b> or <b>[Control]+[Shift]+[U]</b><BR>
As a fail-safe against a hasty undoing operation, this option is provided to re-write 
everything that has been erased by an [Undo].</P>
