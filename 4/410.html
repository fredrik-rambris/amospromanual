<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P>[Store]<BR>
The system works normally if this button is "off", but as soon as it is clicked "on", the 
directory is stored in memory. If there is enough memory available, up to ten different 
directories may be stored with this facility. The positions in the list are stored along 
with the list of files themselves, so that next lime you request a directory, AMOS 
Professional will scan the list of stored directories and attempt to match any requested 
path names. If successful, the directory is displayed instantly, and if unsuccessful, a 
normal search of the disc will take place.</P>


<P>
Below this column of buttons, there is a small slider display indicating available 
memory. The small [X] button to the right of this slider is used to erase the 
current directory from memory. Note that releasing the [Store] button will 
erase <b>all</b> stored directories.</P>

<P>Please note that before available memory is exhausted, AMOS Professional will 
automatically "flush" stored directories, freeing as much memory as possible.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>You can move the File Selector to another position on screen by dragging the title 
  bar with the left mouse button.</LI>

  <LI>The [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] keys can be used to scroll through the list of 
  files.</LI>

  <LI>The [Tab] key can be used to change the path or name of the edit zone.</LI>

  <LI>To summon a new directory, either use the [Get Dir] button or press the [Enter] key.</LI>

  <LI>If error messages are displayed in a small requester, they can be dismissed by a 
  mouse click or by pressing any key.</LI>

  <LI>Because AMOS Professional stores directories in their most recent state, you should 
  use the [Get Dir] option to re-display a large directory that has not had time to be fully 
  displayed when it was stored.</LI>

  <LI>The amount of RAM used by the File Selector depends on the size of the screen and 
  the number of files. File selector routines require 2k, and each file requires its length 
  plus ten bytes (so 100 files of 16 characters needs 3k.)</LI>

</UL>

<P><b>Saving and loading a program</b><br>

Once you have created an AMOS Professional program, it can be saved onto disc using the
[Save] option from the [Project] menu, or by pressing [Amiga]+[S]. The File Selector 
will appear, and you can enter your file name, them press [return] to save it onto the 
disc.</P>

<P>
Programs are loaded using the same system. Select the [Load] option from the [Project] 
menu, or press [Amiga]+[L]. Alternatively, you can load a program into a brand new window 
using the [Open &amp; Load] option, explained later. Choose the name of the program to load by
highlighting it in the File Selector window, then press [Return]. It's as simple as that.</P>

<P>
If your current program is too large for the current Editor window, a dialogue box will 
appear asking if you wish to adapt its size. Selecting the [Yes] option will increase the memory 
to the <b>minimum</b> amount required for holding your program. To add extra lines will prove impossible
unless you make some deletions first. By pressing the [No] option, a SET TEXT BUFFER
operation will be called, setting the buffer area to the <b>exact</b> size required for the 
current program. You can now increase the size of the buffer area as required.</P>
