<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P>Welcome to the AMOS Professional Editor! It is assumed that you have either read the 
last Chapter, or are already familiar with AMOS or Easy AMOS.</P>

<P>AMOS Professional provides one of the most effective and powerful creative environments for
the Amiga programmer. It is also incredibly simple to use. Here is a synopsis of the AMOS
Professional enhancements and improvements over the previous incarnations of the Editor.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The size of the Editor working area has been dramatically increased.</LI>

  <LI>The increased working area is made possible by the provision of a comprehensive 
  system of pull-down menus. The main menu headings are invisible until they are revealed by 
  pressing the <b>right</b> mouse button. The second part of this Chapter provides a detailed guided tour 
  of the vast selection of menu options.</LI>

  <LI>The on-line Help system that was offered by Easy AMOS has been enhanced beyond
  recognition! Instant Help is available for any command, offering definitions, correct 
  syntax and working examples. This allows instant insights into the hundreds of new commands
  provided by AMOS Professional for existing AMOS and Easy AMOS users. <a href="429.html">Chapter 4.2</a>
  contains a full analysis of the Help system.</LI>

  <LI>A Monitor accessory can be called for analysis and reports of actual program 
  listings, and this is explained in <a href="../12/1201.html">Chapter 12.1</a>.</LI>

  <LI>AMOS Professional features a split-screen Editor, allowing you to flick from program 
  to program with a single mouse click.</LI>

  <LI>There is immediate access to printer support, and listings can be printed by 
  selecting a single menu option.</LI>

  <LI>The block system has been dramatically improved, and given its own mode. Block Mode 
  can be entered by double clicking on the <b>left</b> mouse button, or by summoning the [Block] 
  menu.</LI>

  <LI>The SET BUFFER command is now intelligent, allowing you to increase the memory area 
  at any time, without the necessity to save programs first.</LI>

  <LI>Finally, the File Selector is new, improved and extremely friendly!</LI>

</UL>

<P>The AMOS Professional Editor is very easy to use, and it may be tempting to pick up the 
system as you go along, particularly if you have experience of AMOS or Easy AMOS. After a few 
weeks of use, the exploitation of the Editor features will become almost instinctive.</P>

<P><b>However,</b>
	
 if you plunge into the system without a little guidance, you may well end up 
using only a fraction of the Editor's potential capability. The sheer power of the system is 
vast, and it would be a pity to overlook some of its exciting features. It is possible 
that you may only need to refer to this Chapter once, but please make sure that you are 
aware of everything that the AMOS Professional Editor has to offer.</P>

<P><b>The AMOS Professional Editor</b><br>
	
The purpose of the Editor is to make it as easy as possible to create, adapt and modify 
AMOS Professional programs via your screen. To achieve this, the Editor provides a range of 
tools that have been designed with the sole purpose of saving Amiga programmers time, trouble,
frustration and confusion. It also short-circuits the need for ugly, complex program 
listings!</P>

<P>The Editor is intelligent, and will recognise AMOS Professional instructions as they 
are typed in, allowing mistakes to be corrected immediately.</P>
