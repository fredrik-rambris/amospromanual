<PRE>
<img alt="Path String button"
 src="../images/408pstring.jpg" align="top" /> LMB return a file's full path string [F10]
    RMB SYSTEM                   [Shift]+[F10]
</PRE>

<P>
The Direct Mode window can be moved around the screen by dragging it with the left mouse
button, or by pressing the [Ctrl] + [Up Arrow] and [Ctrl] + [Down Arrow] keys. The size of 
the Direct Mode window is changed by dragging its bottom border, or by using the
[Shift]+[Up Arrow] and [Shift]+[Down Arrow] keys.</P>

<P>
You are reminded that the [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] keys are also used to recall up 
to twenty previous lines entered in Direct Mode. Simply hit the [Return] key to execute any
recalled line. The number of lines that can be recalled may be changed from twenty to anything
in the range of zero to 128, and this process is explained in <a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a>.</P>

<P>
To end this examination of AMOS Professional Direct Mode, your attention is drawn to 
the prompt line at the lower left of the Direct Mode Window. The <b>AMOS Pro&gt;</b> prompt is
highlighted, and marks the position at which your typed instructions will appear. The prompt
itself awaits your instructions, which will be executed as soon as you press the [Return] key.</P>

<P><b>The File Selector</b><br>

Please summon up the File Selector now. Simply go to Direct Mode and press [F10] on your
keyboard.</P>

<P>
Programs are stored on discs as "files", and each is given an individual file name. The File
Selector is a means to gain access to individual files, and <a href="../10/1008.html">Chapter 10.2</a> 
is devoted to all the aspects of files stored on disc.</P>

<P>
The AMOS Professional File Selector is faster than its AMOS and Easy AMOS predecessors, it
offers more features and it happens to be a lot better looking! The physical size and positioning
of the File Selector can be changed to your own preferences and this is explained in 
<a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a>. When the AMOS Professional File Selector is summoned, 
it appears like this:</P>
