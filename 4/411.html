<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P><b>Autosave and Autoresume</b><br>

As a default, you will be automatically prompted to save the results of your current
programming session every 30 minutes. A separate Autosave dialogue box will be displayed 
for <b>each</b> window on screen. Pressing [Return] or clicking on the [Yes] button will save your
program to disc under its current file name automatically. If the program has not been
previously saved, the File Selector will be summoned inviting you to enter the new program
name. The time elapse between Autosaves can be changed to your own choice, using the
configuration options detailed later.</P>

<P>
The [Quit options] item from the [Config] menu allows the automatic saving of the 
current programming environment to disc, whenever you leave AMOS Professional. This environment
includes all current programs, along with a complete list of currently open windows. Even 
the cursor positions are saved! This means that when you return to AMOS Professional, your 
screen is exactly as it was, and you can re-commence your programming session at the point from
which it was left. This facility is intended for hard drive users, although it can be 
exploited if you have an additional floppy disc drive, provided that you boot AMOS 
Professional directly, as opposed to from the Workbench, and save your programs on the 
additional external floppy drive. Your start-up disc should be write-enabled to allow 
AMOS Professional to load in this way.</P>

<P><b>The AMOS Professional Editor Menus</b><br>

The following section of this Chapter contains a comprehensive explanation of every 
option available from the AMOS Professional Editor Menus. The menus are examined in the order 
that they appear, from left to right, when the <b>right</b> mouse button is pressed to reveal them. 
All menu headings, menu options and sub-menu items that can be selected via the mouse are shown
between square brackets. Where selections can also be made via the keyboard, the keys are 
also shown in square brackets. A function key appears like this [F1], and a key in the numeric 
keypad appears like this [N1]. For example:</P>

<P>[About AMOS Professional]<BR>
	
This indicates that the menu option is selected by highlighting it with the mouse pointer, and
then releasing the mouse button.</P>

<P>[Run] or [F1]<BR>
	
This means that the option can be chosen via the mouse, or it can be summoned by pressing a
single function key.</P>

<P>[Save As] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[S]<BR>
	
In this case, the option may be selected using the mouse, or by pressing the indicated
combination of keys together.</P>

<P>
Main menu headings are shown in large bold type, with their options printed in smaller bold
type. Where an option has its own sub-menu, the items in the sub-menu are shown in standard
type, as follows: </P>
