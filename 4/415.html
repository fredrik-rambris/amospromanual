Editor</p>

<p>
The [Editor] main menu heading provides the gateway to all of the vital editing commands. 
It is divided into a set of sub-menus, each of which provides a group of important related 
options.</p>

<p><b>[Procedures]</b><BR>
	
This displays a small sub-menu that contains all of the options needed to fold and unfold
procedure definitions. The use of procedures is described in detail in <a href="../5/542.html">Chapter 5.5</a>.</p>
	
<p>[Open/Close] or [F9]<BR>
	
This option is used to fold or unfold the single procedure which is currently under the 
cursor. After this has been done, the <b>whole</b> program is checked for errors, and if a problem is
encountered, an appropriate message is displayed on screen, and the operation is aborted.
If all is well, a closed procedure will be opened to reveal all of its original contents, or an 
open procedure will be folded away and be replaced by a single line containing nothing but the
procedure's name.</p>

<p>
Closed procedures can be cut and pasted as usual, but they cannot be 
deleted using the editor keys. To remove a folded procedure, the [Cut] option should be used.</p>

<p>[Open All] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[O]<BR>
	
Use this option to open all currently folded procedures, displaying the current program in 
its original glory.</p>

<p>[Close All] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[C]<BR>
	
This folds all procedures into memory, leaving a single procedure name line for each one.</p>

<p>[Insert Program]<BR>
	
This option is used to load a machine language routine directly into the selected 
procedure. This procedure will now be closed and its existing contents will be replaced by the new code. 
Please see <a href="../14/1401.html">Appendix A</a> for full details.</p>

<p><b>[Windows]</b><BR>
	
The windows menu is used to set the size and position of editor windows. Here is a list of 
the menu items:</p>
