<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>

<P>[Save] or [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[S]<BR>
	
This will save the Block as a normal AMOS Professional program. It is vital that the start 
and end points of the Block are perfectly aligned, to avoid including nonsense in the 
final program.</P>

<P>[Save Ascii] or [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[A]<BR>
	
This option saves the Block as an Ascii file. This allows it to be edited by a commercial 
text editor.</P>

<p style="background: black; color: white">
Search</p>

<P>
The [Search] menu provides all of the options that are used to search through program 
listings, hunting for specific strings of characters. Once located, these strings can be 
automatically replaced by alternative characters. Users of the original AMOS and Easy AMOS 
systems will find several new features here.</P>

<P>
A Search dialogue box is called up by the relevant option, and this is used to type in 
the string of characters to be sought. The search string can be up to 32 characters long 
and can include any combination of characters, words or instructions.</P>

<P>
Normally all searches will be made forwards in pursuit of exact matches of the given 
characters, but by selecting various options that are explained below, this can be changed. Apart from 
menu options, there are two settings available from the dialogue box, as follows:</P>

<P>[Backward]<BR>
If ticked for selection, the search will start from the current cursor position backwards 
through the program listing.</P>

<P>[Upper Case = Lower Case]<BR>
If ticked, this ignores any distinction between upper and lower case letters in the search string.</P>

<P>After the characters have been typed in, and any options selected, the search is 
launched by pressing the [Return] key or clicking on the [OK] button.</P>

<P>If the search is successful, the cursor will be positioned over the <b>first</b> character in 
the target string, otherwise a "Not found" message is displayed.</P>

<P>Current search preferences are kept, so that next time a search or replace operation is 
carried out in the programming session, your selected options will be ready for use.</P>

<P>[Search New] or [Amiga]+[F]<BR>
	
This searches through the program for the <b>first</b> occurrence of the selected string of 
characters, starting from the current cursor position.</P>

<P>[Search Next] or [Amiga]+[N]<BR>
	
Use this option to search for the next occurrence of the string, after a [Search New] or 
[Replace] operation.</P>
