<p>
Please note that this Menu may not appear exactly as in this User Guide listing, because 
we may have added more information since going to print.</p>

<p>
If you need assistance with any of these topics, simply select one.</p>

<p>
Summoning direct Help during programming is explained later. Please select the [Basics of
AMOS] option now, to reveal a more detailed list of Help topics.</p>

<p><b>Sub-menus</b><br>

As soon as an item is triggered by the left mouse button from the Help system Main Menu, a
selection of related topics is revealed. Any of these new headings can now be selected as 
before. In the case of the [Basics of AMOS] option that you have just selected, they range from 
[The Bare Bones] to [Memory Banks]. Please select the [Text] option that is on your screen now.</p>

<p>
As you have probably guessed, all of the AMOS Professional features relating to [Text] are 
now displayed on screen. Please select [Print] for a demonstration of instant Help. 
Not only will this command be explained in the form of text on your screen, you will also be 
invited to click on the highlighted instruction [Print] and be treated to an instant demonstration program!</p>

<p>
There is so much electronic Help on offer, that this User Guide may seem redundant! Please
keep reading anyway.</p>

<p><b>Summoning Help directly</b><br>
	
In the early stages of AMOS Professional programming, before you become completely 
familiar with all the features, it is all too easy to loose track of the precise format of every 
command. It can be very frustrating to consult this User Guide in the middle of programming, and even
using the various Help menus may break your concentration. To make programming as painless
as possible, Help can be summoned directly from your program listings!</p>

<p>
To receive instant help on any command directly from the Editor, either type in the 
instruction that you are not sure about, or go to an instruction that is already in your program, and 
position the program cursor over the <b>first</b> letter of that word. Now press the [Help] key or click 
on the [H] icon for instant assistance.</p>
