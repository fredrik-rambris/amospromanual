Block</p>

<p>
The [Block] Main Menu heading reveals all of the cut-and-paste commands which enable the
fast copying, movement and deletion of blocks of a program listing. Here are all the 
options:</P>

<P><b>[On/Off]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[B]</b><BR>
Use this option to toggle between the Block mode and the normal Editing mode. The same
change is achieved by double clicking on the <b>left</b> mouse button.</P>

<P>
As soon as the Block mode is entered, the text cursor is replaced by a solid block 
cursor, at the current position.</P>

<P>
A Block is set by holding down the <b>left</b> mouse button, and dragging the cursor to the 
desired destination point. Alternatively, the dimension of the Block can be set directly from the
keyboard using the [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] keys. When a Block is set, it will be 
marked by inverse video highlighting.</P>

<P>
Unlike the original AMOS system, AMOS Professional Blocks can be marked out in units of 
a single character, so the beginning and end Block positions should include <b>whole</b> command words.</P>

<P>
Blocks can be freely copied between different windows, by grabbing a Block into memory 
from the source window with [Store] or [Ctr1]+[S], and then clicking in the relevant line of 
the destination window followed by [Paste] or [Ctrl]+[P].</P>


<P><b>[All Text]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[A]</b><BR>
This selects all text in the current file, ready for block operations.</P>

<P><b>[Store]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[S]</b><BR>
This option is used to store the marked Block into memory, ready for a subsequent [Paste]
operation. The highlighting of the Block will be removed, and you will be returned to 
Editing
mode.</P>

<P><b>[Cut]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[C]</b><BR>
This grabs the marked block into memory, and cuts it out of the program listing 
completely.</P>

<P><b>[Paste]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[P]</b><BR>
To insert an exact copy of the Block at the current cursor position, use this option for a 
Block that has been saved with a [Store] or a [Cut] option.</P>

<P><b>[Forget]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[F]</b><BR>
This option is used to erase a stored Block from the computer's memory.</P>

<P><b>[Print]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[Shift]+[P]</b><BR>
	
If a printer is connected and ready to print, this option is used to list the Block 
directly onto
paper.</P>
