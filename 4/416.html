<br>

<P>[Previous] or [F6]<BR>
This moves the cursor up to the window above the currently active window.</P>

<P>[Next] or [F7]<BR>
When this option is selected, the cursor is positioned over the next window on the 
display.</P>

<P>[Flip Size] or [Amiga]+[N5]<BR>
This reduces the window to a single title line, keeping it displayed and out of the way.</P>

<P>[Split] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[V]<BR>
	
When a new window is opened on the current program via this option, it can be freely
positioned anywhere in the listing. This allows several different sections of the program 
to be displayed on screen simultaneously.</P>

<P>
Please note that this option does <b>not</b> create a separate copy of the program listing in 
memory, it simply splits a single listing between a number of different windows. This means that any
changes will be shown on <b>all</b> of the relevant windows as soon as they are made.</P>

<P>
The [Split Screen] option can be de-activated by the [Close] command in the [Project] 
menu, explained earlier. It can also be turned off with the [Close Window] icon 
on the window title.</P>

<P>
The window title lines will change automatically to reflect the new mode, with the 
"Edit" message to the left of the filename being replaced by "Split".</P>

<P>[Link cursor] or [Amiga]+[C]<BR>
	
This links the movements of the text cursor between any two windows. This means that
whenever one of the selected windows is scrolled through, the other will keep in step.</P>

<P>
The source window is the window which is currently active, and a request will be made to select
the destination window as soon as [Link cursor] is selected. To make your choice, move the
mouse pointer over a window and click once on the <b>left</b> mouse button. The source and
destination windows are now linked together. To separate them, trigger [Link Cursor] again and
click on the source window.</P>

<P>
This option is very useful for copying data from one program to another, as well as for
comparing two programs, line by line.</P>


<p>[Move up] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[N8]<br>
[Move down] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[N2]<br>

These two options move the top of the current window up or down in units of eight pixels,
which is one screen line. It is also possible to position the window directly, by dragging the
mouse pointer on the window title with the <b>left</b> button.</p>

<P>[Expand] or [Amiga]+[N2]<BR>
	
This moves the bottom border of the window eight pixels downwards, increasing its size by 
one screen line.</P>
