<h1>Help</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Additional help</b><br>

There is a complete range of additional help features available to the AMOS 
Professional programmer. Here is a brief introduction to each of them.</P>

<p><b>Error Messages</b><br>

If AMOS Professional encounters any problems with your listings, a wide range of 
helpful messages is available to pinpoint the error. These error messages appear in the 
Information Line Hear the top of the Edit Screen, and they fall into three main categories. Editing 
messages can appear while you are in the process of editing your programs, such as "Line too long". 
Program messages like "FOR without matching NEXT" may be displayed when you [Test] your work,
a lid the program cursor will try to pinpoint where the problem is lurking in your 
listings. Run-time messages come complete with their own number code, and they spotlight errors
encountered while your program is up and running.</P>

<P>
A full list of these error messages can be found in Chapter 12.3, along with an 
explanation of what they mean, and how to deal with the problem. Errors can usually be "trapped", and
<a href="../12/1207.html">Chapter 12.2</a> is devoted to this sport.</P>

<p><b>The AMOS Professional Monitor</b><br>

This feature is used to get inside your programs, examine any AMOS professional routine,
discover exactly what is happening, why it is happening and make a full report on screen. 
The Monitor not only offers help, it provides an instant diagnosis! All is explained in 
<a href="../12/1201.html">Chapter 12.1</a>.</P>

<p><b>Continuing Support</b><br>

It has always been our policy to provide as much help and support to AMOS users as 
possible,and AMOS Professional programmers are offered this assistance too. Future Support is dealt
with in <a href="...14/1468.html">Appendix I</a>, at the back of this User Guide, and you may well want to join the 
network of world-wide clubs and groups offering a huge range of help and support to AMOS
Professional programmers. The services of the AMOS PD Library are detailed in <a href="../14/1467.html">Appendix H</a>.</P>
