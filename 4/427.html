<P>[Menu Messages]<BR>
This option allows you to change the default text of the menu messages to your own wording,
or into a non-English language. Menus are explained in <a href="../6/638.html">Chapter 6.5</a>, and the menu editor is
examined in <a href="../13/1322.html">Chapter 13.3</a>.</P>

Similarly, the wording of the AMOS Professional dialogue boxes can be changed. The whole 
of <a href="../9/901.html">Section 9</a> of this User Guide is devoted to dialogue boxes, buttons and icons, 
and <a href="../13/1346.html">Chapter 13.7</a> explains how to create your own resources.</P>

Similarly, the messages that are called up when a program is run may be changed to your 
own wording. These are also listed in <a href="../12/1211.html">Chapter 12.3</a>.</P>

Editor is returned to its pre-set default settings.</P>

<P><b>[Save Default Configuration]</b><BR>
Use this option to save your own current settings as the default settings, into the 
default AMOSPro.Configuration file. These settings will then be presented whenever AMOS
Professional is run.</P>

this item is used to save the current configuration, ready to be loaded with [Load
Configuration].</P>

<P><b>[Set Interpreter]</b><BR>
Selecting this option will call up a special AMOS written Accessory which allows you to 
define many special features of the AMOS Professional Interpreter. See <a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a> for further 
details.</P>
