<h1>the Editor</h1>

<br>
<P><b>The Editor Window</b><br>

The windows that hold program listings appear immediately below the row of Edit 
icons.</P>

<P>At the top of each window is an Information Line, that displays the title of the 
current "project" and provides a status report. It also displays three Edit Window Icons, 
as follows:</P>

<p>
<img alt="Close button"
 src="../images/402close.jpg" align="top" /> At the left-hand side of the Information Line, there is a small [CLOSE] icon. This 
closes the current window and erases its contents.</P>

<P>Since this is a drastic action, you will be asked to confirm your intentions before the 
window is
closed. Select [Cancel] to abort the closing operation, and leave the current program 
intact.
Please note that when the last window is closed in this way, the program will be erased 
and the
window will be left clean, ready for your next editing action.</P>

<P>You may wish to open a new window now, before experimenting any further. Please hold
down the <b>right</b> mouse button and with the button held down, drag the mouse pointer to the
[Project] menu heading and highlight the [Open New] option. Now release the right mouse
button, and a new window will be opened at once. You can open more windows if you wish,
to prove how simple this is, and then close them again with the [CLOSE] button.</P>

<P>You are allowed as many active windows as you wish, providing that there is enough 
screen space. Once a window has been opened, it may be re-positioned by dragging its Information
Line using the <b>left</b> mouse button, and its size can be changed by dragging its lower border 
in the same way.</P>

<P>Only one window can be active at a time, and this is used for all current editing 
operations, and menu selections. If there is more than one window open, an individual window is selected 
by simply clicking on its contents with the mouse. A flashing cursor will be positioned over 
the relevant programming line. The Information Lines of any inactive windows are reduced to a
dull display, leaving the current active window's display in its original bright 
condition.</P>

<P>There are two other icons at the right-hand end of the Information Line.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Hide button"
 src="../images/402hide.jpg" align="top" />
  The [HIDE] icon is used to hide a normal program from the display. Hidden 
"accessory" programs are available directly from the [AMOS] main menu. Accessories are discussed 
  at the beginning of <a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a>.</P>

<P>
<img alt="Compressor button"
 src="../images/402compress.jpg" align="top" /> 
 This icon is the [COMPRESSOR] button, and it is used to compress a window to a single
 title line, revealing and windows underneath. To expand a window to its original state, 
 simply click on this icon again.</P>

<P><b>The Information Line</b><br>

Between the window icons, the Information Line offers the following status reports,
from left to right.</P>

<div align="right"> <a href="403.html">Back</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<a href="405.html">Next</a>
