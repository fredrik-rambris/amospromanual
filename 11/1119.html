<h1>Libraries and Devices</h1>

<br>

<p><b>The Requester Extension</b><br>

As a default, the AMOS Professional requester routine will be used in preference to hit'
Workbench system requester.</p>

<p>
<b>REQUEST WB</b><br>
<i>instruction: use the Workbench system requester</i><br>
<b>Request Wb</b></p>

<p>
This command is used to switch to the Workbench system requester. As soon as one of the
options is selected from it, you will be returned to AMOS Professional. Please note that if the
Requester Extension is deleted from the extension list by means of the configuration file, then
the standard Workbench requester will be used for displaying messages. This will give the
illusion that AMOS Professional has crashed when a requester appears. If this situation occurs,
simply press [Amiga]+[A] to return to the Workbench, respond to the requester and press
[Amiga]+[A] again to return to AMOS Professional. There should be no need to delete the
Requester extension unless memory is very low.</p>

<p>
<b>REQUEST ON</b><br>
<i>instruction: use the AMOS Professional requester routine</i><br>
<b>Request On</b></p>

<p>
This is the default setting, and is used to make AMOS Professional employ its own requester
routine.</p>

<p>
<b>REQUEST OFF</b><br>
<i>instruction: cancel the requester</i><br>
<b>Request Off</b></p>

<p>
If this instruction is used, AMOS Professional will automatically select the [CANCEL] button of
the requester, and the actual requester will not be displayed. This is ideal for error trapping
Within a program.</p>

<p><b>Control of devices</b><br>

AmigaDOS supports a wide range of devices for your use. Some devices are provided to control
specific items of hardware, such as printers and disc drives, while others offer access to internal
facilities like the synthetic speech handler. The following two functions need no expert
knowledge to use!</p>

<p>
<b>DEV FIRST$</b><br>
<i>function: get the first device from the current device list</i><br>
device$=<b>Dev First</b>(path$)</p>

<p>
This function is similar to DIR FIRST$. A string is returned identifying the first device that
satisfies a chosen search path in the current device list.</p>

<p>
DEV FIRST$("**") will list everything, DEV FIRST$("D/**") will only list disks, and DEV
FIRST$(A/**") is used if you only want to list assigns.</p>
