<h1>Multi-Tasking</h1>

<br>

<p>
AMOS Professional can be run at the same time as totally separate programs and utilities such as
DPaint III. This allows the creation and testing of original AMOS Professional programs while
drawing on the resources of your favourite audio, graphical and utility items.</p>

<p>
Provided that your system has at least one megabyte, multi-tasking is activated by pressing
[Amiga]+[A] to flick between AMOS Professional and the CLI or Workbench environments.</p>

<p>
To make effective multi-tasking programs, most of the processing time should not be grabbed,
leaving only a limited amount of processing power for other tasks, and the following command
is provided to solve this problem.</p>

<p>
<b>MULTI WAIT</b><br>
<i>instruction: force a multi-task wait vbl</i><br>
<b>Multi Wait</b></p>

<p>
The MULTI WAIT instruction should be used in the main loop of an AMOS Professional
program. It forces a multi-task WAIT VBL for situations such as waiting for a menu item to be
selected.</p>

<p>
This command should not be used to achieve accurate screen synchronisation, as it has been
specifically provided for multi-tasking and may skip several vertical blank periods, depending
on the number of tasks being run simultaneously.</p>

<p>
The following simple commands are provided to allow complete control over multi-tasking
facilities.</p>

<p>
<b>AMOS TO BACK</b><br>
<i>instruction: hide AMOS Professional and reveal the Workbench</i><br>
<b>Amos To Back</b></p>

<p>
This instruction allows other programs to be accessed, by bringing forward the Workbench
display and hiding AMOS Professional from view.</p>

<p>
<b>AMOS TO FRONT</b><br>
<i>instruction: hide the Workbench and reveal AMOS Professional</i><br>
<b>Amos To Front</b></p>

<p>
Similarly, this instruction forces AMOS Professional back onto the display, leaving the
Workbench environment hidden.</p>

<p>
<b>AMOS LOCK</b><br>
<i>instruction: disable [Amiga]+[A] toggle</i><br>
<b>Amos Lock</b></p>

<p>
The AMOS LOCK command disables the facility to toggle between AMOS Professional and the
Workbench by pressing [Amiga]+[A]. This can be used to prevent other users from discovering
how your program was written!</p>
