<h1>Speech</h1>

<br>

<p>The parameters are as follows:</p>

<p>
<b>Sex</b> can be set to zero for a male or 1 for a female voice. If you are not satisfied with these
alternatives, zombies, leprechauns and much else besides can be created by playing with the
other parameters.</p>

<p>The <b>mode</b> parameter uses zero for normal speech or 1 for a bizarre rhythmic pattern.</p>

<p>
<b>Pitch</b> is the parameter that changes the audio frequency of the synthetic voice from a deep bass
(65) up to a high soprano (320).</p>

<p>
The final <b>rate</b> parameter tells AMOS Professional how many average-length words to recite per
minute. This can range from a slow drawl (40) to complete gibberish (400).</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>
E> Set Talk 1,1,, : Say "A rhythmic lady."
   Set Talk 0,0,320,350 : Say "Bubbling fish face."
   Set Talk ,,65,40 : Say "I'm a very lazy bullfrog."
   Set Talk 0,,155,70 : Say "Hello, John Major speaking"
</pre>

<p>
<b>TALK MISC</b><br>
<i>instruction: set volume and frequency for speech</i><br>
<b>Talk Misc</b> volume,frequency</p>

<p>Existing AMOS users will find that the AMOS Professional speech facilities have been
augmented and improved. The TALK MISC command allows you to set the volume and
frequency of the narrator voice used for SAY instructions.</p>

<p>
Synthetic speech can be delivered from a whisper to a shout, by setting the volume parameter
between zero for silence, up to 64 for full volume. Frequency is directly adjusted by setting a
value from 5000 to 25000, with some superb effects being generated at slower frequencies. Note
that the higher the frequency setting, the more processor time will be taken in multitask mode.</p>

<p>Try this example:</p>

<pre>
E> For V=16 To 64 Step 8
    For F=5000 To 25000 Step 5000
     Talk Misc V,F
     SAY "I think therefore I AMOS!"
    Next F
   Next V
</pre>

<p>
<b>TALK STOP</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop speech in multitask mode</i><br>
<b>Talk Stop</b></p>

<p>
This simple command is used to terminate synthetic speech delivered by a SAY instruction,
while in multitask mode.</p>
