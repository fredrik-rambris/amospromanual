<h1>Multi-Tasking</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>EXEC</b><br>
<i>instruction: send a CLI command to a device</i><br>
<b>Exec</b> "CLI Command","Output"</p>

<p>
The EXEC instruction executes the specified CLI command, via the named output. Output refers
to the name of an AmigaDos device, and is held in inverted commas. If these are empty "", NIL:
will be used, otherwise the name of the output device must end with a colon.</p>

<p>
"CUR:" specifies that the current CLI window is to be used. If this window does not exist,
because AMOS Professional was booted from the Workbench, then the EXEC command cannot
operate. If "CON:" is used, then a CLI window is opened under the Workbench screen, if
possible. Any other Amiga device can be specified, as long as it is interactive, and it will be
opened before the CLI command is sent, and closed again after the command has been sent,
unless it is the current CLI window.</p>

<p>
For example, to execute an external program copied into the C: directory of AMOS Professional,
and wait for its completion, this could be used:</p>

<pre>
X> Amos To Back : Rem Reveal the Workbench
   Rem Now launch the program in a small CLI window
   Exec "Program Name","CON:0/0/160/48/Program Name"
   Amos To Front : Rem Return to AMOS Pro after the program
</pre>

<p>
<b>PRG STATE</b><br>
<i>function: return the status of how the current program was originally run</i><br>
status=<b>Prg State</b></p>

<p>
Finally, here is a useful function which gives a report on how the current program was
originally run. PRG STATE can return one of three possible values, as follows:</p>

<pre>
<b>Value    Meaning</b>
0       Program is run under the AMOS Professional Editor
1       Program is run under run-time only
-1      Program is compiled
</pre>
