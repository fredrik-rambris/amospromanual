<h1>Speech</h1>

<br>

<p><b>The narrator Mouth</b><br>

Another feature of the narrator device exploited by AMOS Professional is the MOUTH system,
which can be displayed in multitask mode only. The MOUTH functions are used to govern the
shape and movement of an animated mouth on screen, as follows:</p>

<p>
<b>MOUTH WIDTH</b><br>
<i>function: return the width of animated mouth</i><br>
width=<b>Mouth Width</b></p>

<p>
MOUTH WIDTH reports the width of the mouth at any instant, in pixels. This function will
return a negative value if the current speech has finished.</p>

<p>
<b>MOUTH HEIGHT</b><br>
<i>function: return the height of animated mouth</i><br>
height=<b>Mouth Height</b></p>

<p>
Similarly to MOUTH WIDTH, a negative value is returned if the speech is over, otherwise the
current height of the mouth is given in pixels.</p>

<p>
<b>MOUTH READ</b><br>
<i>function: read position of animated mouth</i><br>
position=<b>Mouth Read</b></p>

<p>
This function waits for a mouth movement, and then reads the new mouth values directly into
the MOUTH WIDTH and MOUTH HEIGHT functions, as demonstrated by the usual ready-
made example program.</p>
