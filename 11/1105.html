<p><b>The AMOS Professional Text Font Editor</b><br>

No matter how many fonts are available in your collection, there may be occasions when you
need to create your own character sets, or edit existing fonts for a specific purpose or special
effect. Nothing could be simpler!</p>

<p>
The AMOS Professional Text Font Editor is available on your Accessories disc, allowing fast,
precise and fool-proof loading, editing and saving of text fonts.</p>

<pre>
LD> Load "AMOSPro_Accessories:Font8x8_Editor.AMOS"
</pre>

<p>
The Font Editor screen is divided into three practical areas. The left-hand side of the screen is
used to display an entire character set. The top right-hand area of the screen displays an
enlarged 8 x 8 grid, which holds the individual character to be edited This is the working area.
The bottom right-hand screen contains a simple panel of options.</p>

<p><b>[LOAD FONT]</b><br>
Click on this option now, and a file requester will appear, asking you to load a font for editing.
This may be the Default Font which is available in the APSystem folder,
(AMOSPro.Default.Font).</p>

<p>
After clicking on your choice of font, the individual characters in the set are displayed on the
Font Editor working screen, and any of these characters can be selected by the mouse, for your
attention. As soon as a character is selected, its enlarged image appears in the editing window at
the top right-hand section of the screen.</p>

<p><b>[CLEAR][SET]</b><br>
This pair of options are used to affect <b>all</b> of the pixels that make up the current character, by
either clearing or setting them. Alternatively, individual pixels can be cleared or set by clicking
on them with any mouse button, to toggle their current status.</p>

<p><b>[STORE]</b><br>
The current character also appears in the [STORE] option panel. When you are satisfied with the
edited appearance of the current character, click on this panel to store it into the current font's
character set, before moving to the next operation.</p>

<p><b>[SAVE FONT]</b><br>
After your editing session is finished, the new font is saved to disc by clicking on this option,
and calling up the familiar file selector. After saving, you can continue the editing process, or call
up a new font to be edited.</p>

<p><b>[QUIT]</b><br>
Select this option to return to the AMOS Professional Edit screen.</p>

<p>
You are warned <b>not</b> to destroy the default font, otherwise AMOS Professional will be unusable
the next time it is initialised!</p>
