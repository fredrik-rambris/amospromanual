<h1>Fonts</h1>

<br>

<b>Assigning fonts</b><br>

In the original AMOS system, you were obliged to go back to the Amiga Disc Operating System
every time that the current font directory needed changing. With AMOS Professional, ill('
ASSIGN instruction solves this problem.</p>

<p>
<b>ASSIGN</b><br>
<i>instruction: assign a name to a file or device</i><br>
<b>Assign</b> "Name:" <b>To</b> "New_Pathname"<br>
<b>Assign</b> "Name:" <b>To</b> "Device"</p>

<p>
Supposing that you have an extensive library of fonts installed on a hard disc, as part of your
development system, but you are writing programs for users who only have use of the internal
floppy drive. You will need to test your programs with a reduced number of fonts, and employ
the internal drive instead of your hard disc. This is easily achieved with the following line:</p>

<pre>
X> Assign "Fonts:" To "Df0:Fonts"
</pre>

<p>
Now, every time that GET FONTS or GET DISC FONTS is called, the internal drive will be used
instead of your hard disc.</p>

<b>Converting font coordinates</b><br>

Obviously, with graphic fonts using coordinates measured in pixels, and text fonts positioned by
character coordinates, a set of conversion functions between the two systems is vital.</p>

<p>
<b>XTEXT</b><br>
<b>YTEXT</b><br>
<i>functions: convert graphic coordinates to text coordinates</i><br>
text x-coordinate=<b>Xtext</b>(graphic x-coordinate)<br>
text y-coordinate=<b>Ytext</b>(graphic y-coordinate)</p>

<p>
These self-explanatory functions convert coordinates from the standard graphical screen
coordinates that use pixels, to text coordinates, that are given in character lines and column
spacings. The resulting text coordinates are relative to the current window, and if the screen
coordinate lies outside of this window, a negative value will be returned.</p>

<p>
<b>XGRAPHIC</b><br>
<b>YGRAPHIC</b><br>
<i>functions: convert text coordinates to graphic coordinates</i><br>
graphic x-coordinate=<b>Xtext</b>(text x-coordinate)<br>
graphic y-coordinate=<b>Ytext</b>(text y-coordinate)</p>

<p>
This pair of functions performs the conversion of text format coordinates to graphic format
coordinates, and can be used to position text over an area of graphics on the screen.</p>
