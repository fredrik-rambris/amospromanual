    <h1>The Sample Bank Maker</h1>


    <p>
        The whole purpose of AMOS Professional accessories is to make all aspects of computer
        programming as simple and friendly as possible, while saving the user the time, effort and cost
        of having to go outside of the system.</p>

    <p>
        A ready-made recording studio is provided for creating your own customised sample banks,
        and it can be loaded from the "Accessories" disc now:</p>

    <code class="prefix disc">Load "AMOSPro_Accessories:Sample_Bank_Maker.AMOS"</code>
</section>

<section id="01-the-sample-bank-maker-screen">
    <h2>The Sample Bank Maker screen</h2>
    <p>
        A typical working screen is shown below, and all of its features can be easily identified in the
        short guided tour that follows.</p>

    <div class="center">

        <img alt="Sample bank Maker Screen"
             src="images/1343samplebank.jpg"/>
    </div>

</section>

<section id="02-the-current-sample-window">
    <h2>The Current Sample window</h2>
    <p>
        The top of the screen is divided into two areas. The left-hand side holds the window which is
        used to display the current sample being worked on, in the form of a visual "wave pattern". You
        can load an example and view it in a moment. "Silence" is represented as a straight horizontal
        line in the middle of this Current Sample Window. The various frequencies that make up the
        sound of the current sample are displayed as jagged patterns of vertical lines, running left to the
        right, from the beginning to the end of the sample. As the sample is "played", you can see how
        the wave pattern corresponds to what is heard. Above the Current Sample Window is a
        horizontal display panel, which will show the name of the current sample, along with its length,
        in bytes.</p>

</section>

<section id="03-the-sample-bank-window">
    <h2>The Sample Bank Window</h2>
    <p>
        The upper right-hand section of the screen is where the contents of the sample bank is
        displayed. Each sample is listed with its own number, name and length in bytes. As you would
        expect, a vertical slider bar and slider arrows are provided to display any parts of the contents
        list that are too large to fit into the display. The name of the current sample bank is displayed at
        the top of this window.</p>
</section>

<section id="04-transfer-buttons">
    <h2>Transfer Buttons</h2>
    <p>
        Between the Current Sample Window and the list of samples in the bank are two big buttons,
        marked with a left-arrow and a right-arrow. These are transfer buttons used to move a sample
        between the bank (represented by the top right-hand side of the screen) and the working area
        (represented by the top left-hand side of the screen).</p>

    <p>
        This allows you to pull a sample from the bank, test it or work on it while it is in the Current
        Sample Window, and then deposit it back at the selected position in the bank. If a copy of a
        sample that has been worked on is positioned as the <b>last</b> item in the bank, it becomes a <b>new</b>
        sample to be added at the end of the bank.</p>
</section>

<section id="05-the-information-line">
    <h2>The Information Line</h2>
    <p>
        A horizontal Information Line runs across the width of the screen, below the Current Sample
        Window and the Sample Bank display. This reports on the current status of memory, and
        provides useful messages.</p>
</section>

<section id="06-the-control-panel">
    <h2>The Control Panel</h2>
    <p>
        The lower third of the screen is occupied by all of the control buttons that operate the Sample
        Bank Maker. Please load some samples now, before they can be demonstrated.</p>

    <p><b>Load Bank</b><br>

        <img alt="Load bank button"
             src="images/1344loadbank.jpg" align="left"/>

        the control buttons as usual. Have your "AMOSPro_Examples" disc ready in the drive, and
        prepare to edit "Mixture.Abk" after pressing the [Load Bank] button. The numbers, names and
        lengths of all the samples in this bank should now appear in the display window.</p>

    <p><b>Load current sample from bank</b><br>

        <img alt="Load sample button"
             src="images/1344loadsample.jpg" align="left"/>

        Now load one of the samples into the Current Sample Window, ready for testing.<br>
        For example, select "Bubbler by highlighting its name with a mouse click and pressing the
        [Left arrow] transfer button.
        As soon as a current sample has been transferred, all of the
        other control buttons become active.</p>

    <p><b>Hear a sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Play sample button"
             src="images/1344play.jpg" align="left"/>

        If your audio system is ready, [Hear] the current sample now. See how the
        frequency pattern is shown between the start and end borders of the Current
        Sample Window. You are now ready to begin editing the sample.</p>


    <p><b>Start and end of sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Start and end sample button"
             src="images/1345startsample.jpg" align="left"/>

        Trigger the small [Start] and [End] arrows to move the settings for the beginning
        and end of the current sample. As soon as these settings are moved from the left
        and right boundaries of the window, vertical lines appear to mark the new start
        and end positions. You can also click directly on the start and end lines in the Current Sample
        Window, and drag them to change their positions.</p>

    <p><b>Frequency settings</b><br>

        <img alt="Frequency settings"
             src="images/1345freq.jpg" align="left"/>

        The frequency at which a sample is played is measured in Hertz, and by changing
        this frequency some wonderful effects can be synthesised.<br>
        This panel contains sets of up and down arrow buttons, with

        <img alt="Rapid frequency increase button"
             src="images/1345high.jpg"/>

        for the rapid raising of the frequency, the

        <img alt="Frequency decrease button"
             src="images/1345finedown.jpg"/>

        button for fine-tuning downwards, and so on. Try changing the frequency of the current sample now,
        by decreasing the Hertz setting.
        Settings are normally made using the left mouse button,
        but use of the right mouse button will cause rapid level changes.</p>

    <p><b>Re-name sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Rename sample button"
             src="images/1345rename.jpg" align="left"/>

        Trigger this button if you want to change the name of the edited sample, before storing
        it in the bank. Up to eight characters can be typed in after the prompt, and the new
        name will appear at the top of the screen.</p>

    <p><b>Erase current sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Erase sample button"
             src="images/1345erase.jpg" align="left"/>

        This button is used to erase the currently edited sample.<br>
        It does not effect the original
        version of this sample stored in the sample bank.</p>

    <p><b>Save current sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Save sample button"
             src="images/1345save.jpg" align="left"/>

        When you have finished editing the current sample, you can [Save] everything that is
        held between the start and end lines in the Current Sample Window as an IFF file on the
        current disc.<br>
        This type of file is commonly used to store data that can be read by
        different sampler packages and computers. Any changes that have been made to the sample
        frequency and name will be saved as well as the actual sample data.</p>

    <p><b>Load raw sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Load raw sample button"
             src="images/1345loadraw.jpg" align="left"/>

        When a "raw" sample is loaded, its name is computed from the filename, and its
        frequency is automatically set to 8363 Hertz, which is the Noisetracker default setting. If a
        sample is held in IFF, its own name and frequency are grabbed automatically.</p>

    <p><b>Return sample to bank</b><br>

        <img alt="Return sample button"
             src="images/1345return.jpg" align="left"/>

        If you decide that you want to store any edited changes that have been made to the
        current sample,<br>
        use the large <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> button to deposit the sample back in the
        sample bank.<br>
        The remaining buttons listed below are used to affect the sample bank
        itself, as opposed to any current sample.</p>

    <p><b>Insert empty sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Insert sample button"
             src="images/1345insert.jpg" align="left"/>

        This button inserts an "empty" sample at the position which is currently highlighted
        in the bank. This position can be anywhere you wish. It remains empty,
        waiting to be filled by an edited copy of the current sample.</p>


    <p><b>Delete a sample</b><br>

        <img alt="Delete sample button"
             src="images/1346delete.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is a powerful control button, and care should be taken when using it!<br>
        The highlighted sample is totally erased from the sample bank, and it can not be recovered.</p>


    <p><b>Clear sample bank</b><br>

        <img alt="Clear sample button"
             src="images/1346clear.jpg" align="left"/>

        To clear the entire sample bank, use this button.<br> Again, it must be emphasised that once
        the samples in the bank have been erased from memory, they cannot be recovered.
        Always keep back-up copies of your samples on another disc.</p>

    <p><b>Save As</b><br>

        <img alt="SaveAs button"
             src="images/1346saveas.jpg" align="left"/>

        To save the edited sample bank with a new identity onto disc, the [Save As] option
        should be used.<br>
        After a prompt, you can type in the new name for the bank, which will
        appear above the sample bank window.</p>

    <p><b>Save bank</b><br>

        <img alt="Save bank button"
             src="images/1346savebank.jpg" align="left"/>

        If you do not need to change the name of the bank, simply trigger the [Save Bank]
        button,<br>
        and it will be saved to the current disc.</p>


    <p><b>Quit</b><br>

        <img alt="Quit button"
             src="images/1346quit.jpg" align="left"/>

        To leave the Sample Bank Maker, use the [QUIT] button, which is at the top of the
        screen, and you will be returned to the familiar AMOS Professional Edit Screen.</p>
