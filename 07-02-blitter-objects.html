    <h1>Blitter Objects</h1>


    <p>
        In this Chapter you will learn how to take full advantage of the Amiga's "Blitter" chip, which
        can copy large sections of a screen almost instantaneously.</p>

    <p>
        At its fastest, the Blitter can move a million screen points per second, which is the equivalent of a
        dozen graphic screens. AMOS Professional exploits this facility for the incredible speed achieved
        in commands like SCREEN COPY, but the Blitter is capable of far more than simple graphics.</p>

    <p>
        Professional animations are readily available, using special "Blitter Objects" known as "Bobs".
        Bobs can be displayed at any point on the screen and freely moved over the entire screen area,
        without disturbing any existing graphics. They may be guided, tested for collisions and even
        animated with AMAL, exactly like Sprites.</p>

    <p>
        The main advantage of Bobs over Sprites is that they are far easier to use. There is no imit to the
        size or number of Bobs, and they are stored as part of the current screen, so all positions are
        measured in simple screen coordinates. As has been explained in the previous Chapter, Sprites
        only work in certain combinations, but Bobs may be displayed with no restrictions at all, at any
        position, and in vast numbers. The only limit is the amount of available memory! The other
        main advantage over Sprites is that Bobs can have up to 64 colours.</p>

    <p>
        Naturally, all this power carries a price tag, and although Bobs are more flexible than Sprites,
        they are also slightly slower and consume additional memory. So the ideal solution is to use
        both Sprites and Bobs to their full advantage in the same program. They make a superb team,
        just like your Amiga, AMOS Professional and you!</p>

    <h2>Displaying a Bob</h2>
    <p>
        Images to be used as Bobs are stored in memory Bank 1, and are each referred to by a simple
        number, which ranges from 1 up to the maximum number of objects in the bank. Load up some
        images now, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk"</code>

    <p>
        To find how many objects are in memory bank 1, use the LENGTH function for an instant read-
        out. Type this next line from Direct Mode:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">Print Length(1)</code>

    <p>
        This Object Bank is also used for any Sprite images, so the same objects can be displayed as Bobs
        or Sprites with great ease. To create a Bob, the image of an object is taken from the bank, and
        allocated for display as follows.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-bob">BOB</h3>
    <i>instruction: display a Bob on screen</i><br>
    <b>Bob</b> number,image<br>
    <b>Bob</b> number,x,y,image</p>

    <p>
        Each Bob must be given an identification number from 0 to 63. As a default, only 64 Bobs may be
        displayed on screen at once, but this limit can be increased if necessary.</p>


    <p>
        Unlike Sprites, which use complex hardware coordinates, Bobs are displayed using standard
        screen coordinates, measured from the top left-hand corner of the current screen. Set the
        position of your new Bob by giving it screen coordinates relative to the hot spot of your chosen
        image number. Hot spots are explained at the end of the last Chapter.</p>

    <p>
        If the coordinates lie outside of the existing screen area, the Bob will not be displayed. So objects
        can be initialised off screen, ready to be moved into place during the course of your program.</p>

    <p>
        Once a Bob has been positioned on screen, the coordinate values become optional. The values of
        any coordinate parameters that are omitted will be remembered from the last time they were set.
        In Chapter 7.6 it is explained how this technique is valuable for animating Bobs with AMAL,
        because it allows objects to be moved effortlessly, without disturbing any existing animation
        sequences. It is vital to include all commas in their normal positions if coordinate values are
        omitted, or a syntax error will be reported. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">Bob 1,160,100,1 : <comment>Rem Position Bob 1 at 160,100 using image1</comment>
Bob 1,,150,1 : <comment>Rem Move Bob 1 down 50 pixels</comment>
Bob 1,110,,1 : <comment>Rem Move Bob 1 50 pixels left</comment>
Bob 1,,,2 : <comment>Rem Display new image 2 at Bob 1 current position</comment>
</code>

    <p>
        Before examining the next instant demonstration program, here is a step-by-step technique for
        correctly displaying a Bob.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First, some images must be made available for Bobs to use, with a call to LOAD the
            appropriate filename. Once images have been loaded, they are saved as part of your Basic
            program automatically.
        </li>

        <li>If you intend to load a picture for use as a background screen, now is the time to do it.
            Use a line such as:
        </li>
    </ul>

<code class="prefix ex">Load Iff "Picture.IFF"</code>

    <p>
        Alternatively, the default screen can be prepared by removing the flashing cursor from the
        display and filling the display with a large block of colour, usually black. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Load Iff "Picture.IFF"</code>

    <ul>
        <li>Now the correct image colours should be grabbed from the Object Bank. Note that if Bobs are
            to be displayed against an existing background screen, you will need to ensure that the images
            use exactly the same colour values as your picture, otherwise serious colour clashes will be
            generated. GET BOB PALETTE can be called if you are using Bobs on their own, or call GET
            SPRITE PALETTE for use with either Sprites or Bobs.
        </li>

        <li>The automatic AMOS Professional "double buffering" system should now be engaged, with a
            simple DOUBLE BUFFER command. The theory and practice of this is explained later, but in
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        essence, double buffering creates an invisible copy of the current screen where drawing
        operations take place, resulting in beautifully smooth movement effects.

        <li>Finally, your Bobs are assigned their individual starting positions. This could be a simple series
            of BOB commands, or a complex pattern of off-screen starting points for each level of an arcade game.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="02-general-bob-commands">
    <h2>General Bob Commands</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-bob-off">BOB OFF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: remove a Bob from display</i><br>
        <b>Bob Off</b><br>
        <b>Bob Off</b> number</p>

    <p>
        Use this command to remove all Bobs from the screen simultaneously. If a Bob number is
        specified, only that Bob will be extinguished. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Bob Off 1: <comment>Rem Remove Bob1 only</comment>
Bob Off : <comment>Rem Remove all Bobs from screen</comment>
</code>

    <p>
        The BOB OFF instruction also turns off any animation or collision routines associated with these
        Bobs.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-x-bob">X BOB</h3>
    <p><i>function: get x-coordinate of a Bob</i><br>
        x-coordinate=<b>X Bob</b>(number)</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-y-bob">Y BOB</h3>
    <p><i>function: get y-coordinate of a Bob</i><br>
        y-coordinate=<b>Y Bob</b>(number)</p>

    <p>
        It is not difficult to keep track of Bobs under normal circumstances, but if Bobs are moved with
        AMAL, their coordinates can vary unpredictably. In which case, the X BOB and Y BOB functions
        may be used to get a snapshot of their current position, by returning the screen coordinates of
        your selected Bob. Specify the number of the chosen Bob on screen, and the appropriate
        coordinate will be returned, as measured from the top left-hand corner of the screen to the hot
        spot of the current image. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk"
Curs Off : Cls 0: <comment>Rem Set up screen</comment>
Flash Off : Get Bob Palette : <comment>Rem Grab Bob colours from image bank</comment>
Double Buffer : <comment>Rem Engage double buffering</comment>
Autoback 1: <comment>Rem Engage fast drawing mode</comment>
Do
 <comment>Rem Move Bob1 with mouse</comment>
 <comment>Rem Convert hardware coords to screen coords</comment>
 Bob 1,X Screen(X Mouse),Y Screen(Y Mouse),1
 <comment>Rem Print new location on screen</comment>
 Locate 0,0 : Print X Bob(1);" ";Y Bob(1);" ";
Loop
</code>


    <p>
        AMOS Professional provides many alternative methods of moving Bobs, and each Bob can
        display a sequence of different images to create animation. When animating Bobs with AMAL, it
        is possible to loose track of the precise image currently displayed, so the next function has been
        supplied to rectify this.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-i-bob">I BOB</h3>
    <p><i>function: get image number used by a Bob</i><br>
        image=<b>IBob</b>(number)</p>

    <p>
        I BOB returns the number of the image currently assigned to the specified Bob number. If the
        Bob number you want to examine does not exist, an illegal function error will be given, so it is
        vital to define the Bob correctly before calling I BOB. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk"
Flash Off : Get Bob Palette : Double Buffer : Autoback 0
Bob 1,160,100,1: <comment>Rem Display Bob 1 at centre of screen</comment>
Do
 For IMAGE=1 To Length(1) : <comment>Rem Create simple animation</comment>
  <comment>Rem Move Bob 1 with the mouse</comment>
  Bob 1,X Screen(X Mouse),Y Screen(Y Mouse),IMAGE
  For W=0 To 3 : Wait Vbl : Next W
  <comment>Rem Display image number on screen</comment>
  Locate 0,0 : Print "Image ";I Bob(1);" ";
 Next IMAGE
Loop
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-get-bob-palette">GET BOB PALETTE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: load image colours into current screen</i><br>
        <b>Get Bob Palette</b><br>
        <b>Get Bob Palette</b> mask</p>

    <p>
        This command loads the whole colour palette used for your Bobs into the current screen. A
        mask can be added if you like, which will load a selection of these colours only. Each individual
        colour is represented by one "bit" of the mask being set to a zero (off) or a one (on). Colours run
        from right to left, so that colour zero is represented by the bit at the right-hand end of the mask,
        colour 1 is second from the right, and so on. Supposing there are 16 colours in your Bob palette,
        you would copy the first four colours like this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Get Bob Palette %0000000000001111</code>
</section>

<section id="03-unmasking-bobs">
    <h2>Unmasking Bobs</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-no-mask">NO MASK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: remove colour zero mask from Bob</i><br>
        <b>No Mask</b> number</p>
    <b>No Mask</b> number</p>


    <p>
        A "mask" means that the background colour (colour zero) around a Bob is made transparent, so
        t hat the screen graphics show through. The mask is also used by certain collision detection
        routines. A mask is automatically set up for every Bob, and the NO MASK command takes away
        this mask, so that the entire Bob image is drawn on the screen, including its original background
        colour and any other graphics in colour zero. To remove a mask, simply use this command
        followed by the number of the Bob image you are interested in.</p>

    <p>
        Never remove a mask from a Bob while it is being displayed on screen, or its image will be
        scrambled! Remember to always use the BOB OFF command first.</p>
</section>

<section id="04-bob-priority">
    <h2>Bob Priority</h2>
    <p>
        It is important to understand that every Bob automatically possesses a priority of importance,
        and that this priority is based on the Bob's number. So a Bob carries a priority value from 0 to 63,
        and AMOS Professional uses this value to decide in which order Bobs are displayed and which
        Bobs barge their way in front of others when moving around the screen.</p>

    <p>
        The general rule is that a Bob with a higher priority number is displayed in front of one with a
        lower priority number. For example, Bob 5 would cut in front of Bob 4, but be obscured if Bob 6
        crossed its path. So it is clear that this priority system should always be remembered when you
        number your Bobs.</p>

    <p>
        AMOS Professional allows changes in the priority system to suit your needs, this first system
        offers an alternative based not on Bob numbers, but on the position of Bobs on the screen.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-priority-on">PRIORITY ON</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set Bob priority to highest y-coordinate</i><br>
        <b>Priority On</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-priority-off">PRIORITY OFF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set Bob priority to default status</i><br>
        <b>Priority Off</b></p>

    <p>
        When PRIORITY ON is used, Bobs with the highest y-coordinates take priority on the screen. It
        is usually best to set hot spots at the bottom of Bobs to exploit this priority, and some superb
        perspective effects can be created. All that is needed to re-set the original Bob number priorities
        is to use the PRIORITY OFF command.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-priority-reverse-on">PRIORITY REVERSE ON</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: toggle on Reverse Priority of Bobs</i><br>
        <b>Priority Reverse On</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-priority-reverse-off">PRIORITY REVERSE OFF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: toggle off Reverse Priority of Bobs</i><br>
        <b>Priority Reverse Off</b></p>


    <p>
        The PRIORITY REVERSE ON command changes around the entire priority table based on Bob
        numbers. Not only does it give a lower Bob number priority over a higher Bob number, when
        used with PRIORITY ON it also gives priority to a Bob with the lowest y-coordinate. As you
        would expect, PRIORITY REVERSE OFF sets the priority system back to normal.</p>
</section>

<section id="05-bobs-and-screens">
    <h2>Bobs and screens</h2>
    <p>AMOS Professional offers a full range of commands to allow Bobs and screens to interact.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-limit-bob">LIMIT BOB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: limit bobs' visibility to part of screen</i><br>
        <b>Limit Bob</b> x1 ,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2<br>
        <b>Limit Bob</b> number,x1,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2<br>
        <b>Limit Bob</b></p>

    <p>
        Restricts the visibility of a numbered Blitter OBject to the LIMITs of a
        rectangle on screen. You set up the size of this rectangle by simply
        entering its coordinates.</p>

    <p>
        If LIMIT BOB is followed with a Bob number, then only that Bob becomes restricted by the
        boundaries of the rectangle.</p>

    <p>
        Note that the width of the rectangle must always be wider than the width of the Bob, and that
        the x -coordinates are always rounded up to the nearest 16-pixel boundary. To keep Bob number
        1 trapped inside an area, you would use something like this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Limit Bob 1,10,0 To 320,100</code>

    <p>
        Remember that a Bob must be called up with the BOB command before LIMIT BOB is used,
        otherwise the limitation will have no effect. To remove a Bob's visibility limit,
        use the command without any coordinates, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Limit Bob</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-double-buffer">DOUBLE BUFFER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: activate Double Buffering system</i><br>
        <b>Double Buffer</b></p>

    <p>
        Throughout this Chapter, extensive reference is made to the technique known as "double
        buffering". The DOUBLE BUFFER command creates an invisible copy of the current screen and
        stores it as a "logical screen". All graphics operations, including Bob movements, are now
        performed directly on this logical screen, without disturbing your existing display at all. This is
        because the existing display on your television screen is taken straight from the original screen
        area, now called the "physical screen".</p>

    <p>
        Once the image has been re-drawn, the logical screen and physical screen are swapped over.
        The old logical screen is flicked onto the display, and the old physical screen is hidden away to
        become the new logical screen. The entire process now cycles continuously, producing a solid,
        smooth display, even when dozens of Bobs are moving on the same screen.</p>


    <p>
        Any complexities of this technique are completely automatic, so once DOUBLE BUFFER has
        been engaged, you can relax.</p>

    <p>
        Since hardware Sprites are overlaid directly onto your television display, double buffering will
        hive no effect at all on any existing Sprite animations.</p>

    <p>
        The double buffering system works equally well in all of the Amiga's graphics modes, and can
        also be used in conjunction with dual playfields. You should be aware that double buffering
        requires two separate areas of memory, one for the logical and one for the physical screen. So it
        will double the amount of memory required, for example an extra 32k will be needed for a
        standard 16-colour screen. This means that if you try and DOUBLE BUFFER too many screens,
        available memory will be exhausted.</p>

    <p>
        In practice, double buffering is invaluable, and the additional memory required is well spent. It
        can be exploited for advanced three-dimensional routines, and is especially useful for scrolling
        screen effects, because the new areas of display are copied straight into the invisible background
        without corrupting the current display.</p>

    <p>
        As an optional extra, AMOS Professional provides total control over the entire DOUBLE
        BUFFER system, and a full explanation may be found in the next Chapter. For a rapid insight
        into the effect of not using DOUBLE BUFFER, make sure you run the HELP_26 demonstration
        program.</p>

    <p>
        That demonstration produces a horrible flickering effect. Whenever a Bob moves around the
        screen, the graphics beneath it are replaced at their original position. Unfortunately, since Bobs
        are updated at the same time as the screen images, this sort of flickering effect is generated. By
        including a DOUBLE BUFFER command, screens are switched <b>after</b> the drawing process is
        complete, and as explained above, the process is completely automatic.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-get-bob">GET BOB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: grab an image from part of screen</i><br>
        <b>Get Bob</b> image,x1,x2 <b>To</b> x2,y2<br>
        <b>Get Bob</b> screen number,image,x1,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2</p>

    <p>
        This command grabs a selected part from the current screen and copies it straight into the
        Object Bank. After giving the image number to be created, set the area to be grabbed from the
        top left-hand corner to the bottom right-hand coordinates. If your chosen image number already
        exists, the existing image will be replaced by the new picture, otherwise the new picture will be
        added to the bank.</p>

    <p>
        An optional screen number may be given immediately after the GET BOB command, allowing
        an image to be grabbed from a specific screen. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Curs Off : Cls 0 : Double Buffer : Flash Off
Text 50,10, "AMOS Professional Basic!"
Get Bob 1,50,0 To 250,20
For B=0 To 180
 Bob 1,50,B,1
 Wait Vbl
Next B
</code>


    <p>
        GET BOB is an extremely useful command, allowing any section of a screen to be loaded into a
        Bob, and then manipulated with the AMAL system. You can even write your own object editor
        from start to finish! It is also possible to create and modify Bob images from AMOS Professional
        Basic. This allows, you to produce stand-alone program listings that will run without the need
        for external image files. Try the next example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Double Buffer : Flash Off : Curs Off
<comment>Rem Draw an expanding circle and grab it as a Bob</comment>
For C=1 To 15
 Ink 5 :Circle 16,16,C: Paint 16,16

 Cls 0,0,0 To 32,32
Next C

Loop

    <h3 class="command" id="i-put-bob">PUT BOB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: put a fixed copy of a Bob on screen</i><br>
        <b>Put Bob</b> number</p>

    <p>
        The PUT BOB command takes the Bob whose number is given and fixes a permanent copy of its
        image on the screen, at the current position. This is achieved by preventing the background area
        beneath the Bob from being re-drawn. Note that after the image has been copied, the original
        Bob can be animated and moved with no ill effects.</p>

    <p>
        In actual fact, PUT BOB is included as a support for STOS programmers, who wish to make their
        old Atari STOS programs compatible with AMOS Professional. Because it only works with single
        buffered screens, it is not particularly useful, and PASTE BOB is recommended as the preferred
        command. Please see below.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-paste-bob">PASTE BOB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: draw an image from Object Bank</i><br>
        <b>Paste Bob</b> x,y,image</p>

    <p>
        PASTE BOB takes an image held in the Object Bank, and draws it straight onto the current
        screen. Unlike the PUT BOB command, the image is drawn immediately, so there is no need to
        add the WAIT VBL commands before proceeding.</p>

    <p>
        It is important to note that the coordinates for the given image number are measured from the
        top left-hand corner of the image, and take no account of the current hot spot setting!</p>


    <p>
        PASTE BOB is just like any other graphics instruction, so it does not need a double buffered
        screen. It can be used to generate a range of extremely fast graphical operations, and it is also
        useful for mapping complex displays in scrolling arcade games. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Flash Off : Curs Off : Cis 0

    <h2>Bob Bank Commands</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-del-bob">DEL BOB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: delete an image from the Object Bank</i><br>
        <b>Del Bob</b> number<br>
        <b>Del Bob</b> first <b>To</b> last</p>

    <p>
        The DEL BOB command permanently deletes one or more Bob images from the Object Bank. To
        erase a single image, simply give the image number to be deleted, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Del Bob 2</code>

    <p>
        Whenever an image is deleted, all the subsequent images in the Bank are moved up one place in
        the numerical order. For instance, if the Bank originally contained four images, the above
        example would remove image number 2 from memory, leaving a gap between images 1 and 3.
        This gap would be filled immediately, as the old image numbers 3 and 4 were shunted up one
        place, to become the new image numbers 2 and 3.</p>

    <p>
        If more than one image is to be removed from the Bank, you can set the range from the first
        image to the last after a DEL BOB command. The following example would delete Bob images
        4,5,6 and 7:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Del Bob 4 To 7</code>

    <p>
        After the last image has been deleted from the Object Bank, the entire Bank is erased automatically.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-ins-bob">INS BOB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: insert a blank Bob image into the Object bank</i><br>
        <b>Ins Bob</b> number<br>
        <b>Ins Bob</b> first <b>To</b> last</p>

    <p>
        INS BOB inserts a blank image at the numbered position in the current Object Bank. All of the
        images after this numbered position will then be moved down one place in the numerical order.
        The second version of this command allows you to create several spaces in a single operation, by
        giving the range of new gaps between the first and last image numbers that you specify.</p>

    <p>
        Any of these new image spaces are completely empty, and so cannot be allocated to a Bob or
        displayed directly on screen while they are still blank. An actual image must first be grabbed
        into the Object Bank, using a GET SPRITE or GET BOB command. If this is not done, the
        appropriate error message will be given as soon as you try to access the empty image.</p>

    <p>
        Both DEL BOB and INS BOB are provided to be used with the GET BOB and GET SPRITE
        commands. They allow you to modify and adjust your Bob images from inside AMOS
        Professional programs, with complete freedom. They may be used to create numerous special
        effects such as interactive screen animations and animated brushes, as used in Deluxe Paint.</p>

    <h2>Flipping Bob Images</h2>
    <p>
        AMOS Professional is designed to meet every programming need when it comes to animating
        images. You will often need to animate mechanical objects and cartoon characters as realistically
        as possible, so every movement sequence must be created from a number of images, and each
        image in the sequence must be carefully drawn using the Object Editor, ready for smooth
        animation with AMAL.</p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, perfectly animated sequences need a great many images, which take up a great
        deal of memory. To move the animated character in several directions makes the problem much
        worse, because each direction needs a separate sequence of images.</p>

    <p>
        AMOS Professional cuts such waste of memory to a minimum. This is achieved by allowing you
        to display the same image in different orientations, so that a character can be mirrored and
        turned upside down, simply by flipping its image.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-hrev">HREV</h3>
    <p><i>function: flip an image horizontally</i><br>
        new number=<b>Hrev</b>(image number)</p>

    <p>
        This function reverses an image from left to right, creating a mirror image. Use HREV by
        specifying the existing image number (in brackets) to be flipped horizontally, in order to create a
        new identification number for the reversed image. This new image number can be freely used
        with any of the standard Bob commands.</p>


    <p>Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk" : <comment>Rem Load Bob images from disc</comment>
Curs Off.: Cls 0 : <comment>Rem Set up screen</comment>
Flash Off : Get Bob Palette : <comment>Rem Grab Bob colours from image bank</comment>
Double Buffer : <comment>Rem Engage Double Buffering</comment>
For X=360 To -60 Step -4: <comment>Rem Move Bob across screen</comment>
 Bob 1,X,100,2 : <comment>Rem Display Bob at a new position</comment>
 Wait Vbl : <comment>Rem Wait for next vertical blank period</comment>
Next X
For X=-60 To 400 Step 4: <comment>Rem Flip image and move from left to right</comment>
 Bob 1,X,100,Hrev(2) : <comment>Rem Display Bob at new position</comment>
 Wait Vbl : <comment>Rem Wait 50th of second for Vbl</comment>
Next X
</code>

    <p>
        There is a hexadecimal version of this function, and the value returned by the HREV function is
        in the following format:</p>

    <p>$800+n</p>

    <p>
        Where $8000 is a "flag" telling AMOS Professional to reverse the Bob whenever it is displayed on
        screen, and where n is the number of your image. This technique can be used to flip images
        directly from an AMAL animation sequence.</p>

    <p>Supposing your original sequence was created with this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">"Anim 0,(1,2)(2,2)(3,2)(4,2)"</code>

    <p>To reverse these images, either of the following two lines could be used:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">"Anim 0,(1,2)(2,2)(3,2)(4,2)"</code>

    <p>
        When an image is reversed like this, the location of the hot spot is reversed horizontally too. So
        if the hot spot was originally in the top left-hand corner, the hot spot of the HREV image will be
        in the top right-hand corner: Depending on the image involved, this can have a great effect on
        the way your image is displayed on screen. Be careful to position your hot spots sensibly, or
        avoid any risks by setting them centrally, using the appropriate HOT SPOT command.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-vrev">VREV</h3>
    <p><i>function: flip an image vertically</i><br>
        new number=<b>Vrev</b>(image number)</p>

    <p>
        VREV is identical to HREV, except that it takes the specified image and turns it upside down
        before displaying it on the screen. This is best used for animated objects that move vertically,
        although comic effects can be achieved with cartoon characters.</p>


    <p>
        As with HREV, there is an equivalent hexadecimal version of the VREV function, which can be
        used with AMAL animation strings. The format is:</p>

    <p>$4000+n</p>

    <p>
        Where $4000 acts as the reversal flag, and n is the image number. Here are two typical AMAL
        string of reversed animation:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">"Anim 0,($4000+1,2)($4000+2,2)($4000+3,2)($4000+4,2)"

X> "Anim 0,($4001,2)($4002,2)($4003,2)($4004,2)"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-rev">REV</h3>
    <p><i>function: double-flip an image vertically and horizontally</i><br>
        new number=<b>Rev</b>(image number)</p>

    <p>
        REV combines HREV and VREV into a single function. It takes the image whose number is held
        in brackets, reverses it from left to right and then performs another reversal from top to bottom.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk"
Curs Off : Cls 0
Flash Off : Get Bob Palette
Double Buffer
For Y=200 To -40 Step -1
 Bob 1,Y*2,Y,1
 Wait Vbl
Next Y
  For Y=-40 To 200
Bob 1,Y*2,Y,Rev(1)
Wait Vbl
  Next Y
</code>

    <p>
        Don't forget to try the HELP programs for a demonstration. If your own attempts at flipping
        Bob images cause any problems, you may wish to consult the Bob Doctor, below.</p>
</section>

<section id="08-the-bob-doctor">
    <h2>The Bob Doctor</h2>
    <p>
        Here are some free consultations which answer common problems encountered when flipping
        Bobs.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> When I use flipped Bobs on screen with their original images, my display slows down
        to a crawl.<br>
        <b>Remedy</b>: Do not display the same image in different orientations on screen at the same time.
        AMOS Professional flips images during the updating process, just before Bobs are re-drawn on
        screen. Once reversed, images stay in this new state until displayed in a different direction.
        Whenever AMOS Professional flips a reversed image, it first needs to restore the image to its
        original state. This takes a great deal of processor time, and slows down your display.</p>


    <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> Can I reverse an image for later use, without displaying it on screen?<br>
        <b>Remedy:</b> Yes. PASTE BOB works perfectly with flipped images, and can be used directly with
        HREV, VREV and REV. If you want to reverse an image quickly, without displaying a Bob, try
        something like this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Paste Bob 500,500,Vrev(1)</code>

    <p>
        Since the coordinates lie outside of the current screen area, the image is not displayed, but it is
        still flipped by the PASTE BOB command.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> I want to flip my Sprites as well as my Bobs?<br>
        <b>Remedy:</b> The flip functions do not work with Sprites directly, but there is no problem in
        displaying a flipped Bob image as a Sprite. This line would be completely ignored:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Sprite 8,300,100,Hrev(5)</code>

    <p>But the following routine will solve your problem:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.abk"
Curs Off : Cls 0 : Flash Off : Get Sprite Palette
Paste Bob 50,50,Vrev(5)
Sprite 8,300,100,5
Wait Vbl
</code>

    <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> Can I check for a collision between two copies of the same image, for example,
        between an original image and its own mirror-image?<br>
        <b>Remedy:</b> Yes, but it is not recommended. If the image's hot spot has been centred the results
        should be acceptable, but if the hot spot is asymmetrical you will generate unpredictable
        problems.</p>
