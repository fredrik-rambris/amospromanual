<h1>Copper Lists</h1>

<br>

<p>
However, multiple screens and Sprites are only supported by the standard AMOS Professional
copper system, so you cannot use SCREEN OPEN, SCREEN DISPLAY, RAINBOWS or any of
the SPRITE commands. If you need to generate such effects, you will have to program them for
yourself! For those of you who wish to give up now, the following command may be useful.</p>

<p><b>COPPER ON</b><br>
<i>instruction: re-start automatic copper generation</i><br>
<b>Copper On</b></p>

<p>
The COPPER ON command re-starts all standard copper calculations, and returns AMOS
Professional back to normal. The experts (and foolhardy) may now continue.</p>

<p><b>COP MOVE</b><br>
<i>instruction: write a MOVE instruction to current copper list</i><br>
<b>Cop Move</b> address,value</p>

<p>
MOVE is an internal instruction used by the copper, and it is very similar to the AMOS
Professional DOKE command. It inserts a MOVE command into the current logical copper list,
by copying a value from 0 to 65535 into the selected register address. The address refers to a
copper register from $7F to $1BE.</p>

<p><b>COP MOVEL</b><br>
<i>instruction: write a long MOVE instruction to copper list</i><br>
<b>Cop Movel</b> address,value</p>

<p>
This is a special option from AMOS Professional Basic, which generates a matched pair of
MOVE commands in the new copper list. These load a 32-bit (long word) value into the selected
address, exactly like a normal LOKE instruction.</p>

<p><b>COP WAIT</b><br>
<i>instruction: insert a WAIT instruction into copper list</i><br>
<b>Cop Wait</b> x,y<br>
<b>Cop Wait</b> x,y,xmask,ymask<br>

<p>
The COP WAIT command enters a WAIT instruction at the current position in the copper list.
WAIT forces the copper to stop in its tracks until the screen has been drawn at the specified
hardware coordinates x,y. The copper then continues from the next instruction in the copper
list.</p>

<p>
WAIT is usually called immediately before a MOVE command, creating a pause until the display
reaches a specific screen line. The MOVE instruction is then used to change the attributes of the
screen area below this line. Rainbows are an excellent example of this technique, with each line
of the rainbow generated with a pair of commands like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Cop Wait 0,Y : Rem Y is starting coordinate of next colour shift
   Cop Move $180,$777 : Rem $180 is address of colour 0 and $777 is new colour
</pre>
