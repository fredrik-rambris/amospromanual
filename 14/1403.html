<h1>Machine Code</h1>

<br>

<p>
This character acts as an introduction sign, to indicate that the number which follows it is in
hexadecimal notation, rather than the standard decimal system.</p>

<p>
After the decimal value that is to be converted, an optional number can be added which sets the
number of digits to be returned in the hex string. If this parameter is omitted, AMOS
Professional will return the value in the fewest possible digits needed to express the hex
number. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Print Hex$(100)
   Print Hex$(100,3)
</pre>

<p>
HEX$ is often used with the COLOUR function to display the precise mixture of Red, Green and
Blue components in a particular colour, as follows:</p>

<pre>
D> Print Hex$(Colour(2))
</pre>

<p>
Hexadecimal notation is ideal for handling large numbers such as addresses, and it may be
entered directly in any AMOS Professional Basic expression. The $ (dollar) character must be
placed in front of hex numbers, and they will be converted into standard decimal notation
automatically. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Print $64
   Print $A
</pre>

<p>
Do not confuse the use of the <b>leading</b> $ character for a hex number with the use of a <b>trailing</b> $
character for a string. $A is a hexadecimal number, but A$ is a variable!</p>

<p><b>Manipulating memory</b><br>

A "byte" is a single unit of data, resident at an address in memory. If no unit of data exists at a
particular address, the address remains empty. Each byte can hold a number between 0 and 255.
Each byte is made up of eight smaller units of memory called "bits", and a bit is the smallest unit
of data that can be represented in a computer's memory by a 1 or a 0.</p>

<p><b>PEEK</b><br>
<i>function: read a byte from an address</i><br>
byte=<b>Peek</b>(address)</p>

<p>The PEEK function returns a single 8-bit byte from an address in memory.</p>

<p><b>POKE</b><br>
<i>instruction: change a byte at an address</i><br>
<b>Poke</b> address,number</p>

<p>
The POKE command moves a number from 0 to 255 into the memory location at the specified
address. Take great care with this instruction! Only POKE addresses that you completely
understand, such as the contents of an AMOS Professional memory bank. Random poking will
provoke your Amiga into taking horrible reprisals!</p>
