<h1>App. E: Memory Bank Structures</h1>

<br>

<p>
The AMOS Professional package comes complete with an invaluable range of accessory
programs, allowing the serious programmer to generate all of the requirements needed to
produce commercial quality products. We have provided as much material as is possible on disc,
but there is a finite limit to the disc space available. To be blunt, we do not have the magnetic
resources to cover every possibility for creative AMOS Professional programming. The system
has been designed to be infinitely accommodating, and it is our intention to expand and
improve the core system to meet all of your requirements.</p>

<p>
After using AMOS Professional, you may well identify an area which has scope for a new
accessory. Perhaps you have a special interest in a music editor, or sound effects, or speech
synthesis, graphic tweening, DTP, in fact any aspects of enhancing the AMOS system. We are
always <b>very</b> interested in making contact with creative, innovative talent, that can take the
AMOS Professional system to its next phase of evolution. In other words, if you feel that you can
create an important <b>new</b> AMOS Professional accessory, you should submit it to us on disc, along
with all relevant documentation.</p>

<p>
But...<br>
Before you can create such a vital accessory, you must understand the internal structure of the
various AMOS Professional memory banks. This will allow you to generate such banks <b>directly</b>
from your AMOS Professional programs.</p>

<p>
Much of the information in this Appendix is very technical, and it is likely to prove heavy going
for anyone who is not an experienced programmer. In order to exploit it successfully, you are
going to have to explore the Amiga's memory very carefully. There will only be one major
<b>warning</b> in this Appendix: if you make a mistake in the realms of memory bank manipulation,
you will crash your computer!</p>

<p>
For those genuine professional programmers who are about to persevere with innovation and
exploitation of the AMOS Professional system, you should be able to generate some amazing
accessories by analysing this information. Go ahead. Make our day!</p>

<p><b>General Information</b><br>

Each AMOS Professional program can have its own unique list of associated memory banks.</p>

<p>All banks are introduced by a standard memory header.</p>

<p>
In the original AMOS package, the memory banks were represented using an internal array of
just fifteen addresses. These were used to hold the current memory location of each bank
assigned to a standard AMOS program. The evolved AMOS Professional package uses a much
more flexible system, allowing as many memory banks as you need.</p>

<p>
Memory banks are now stored using a "linked list", which works like a chain, with each header
containing a "pointer" to the next header in the Amiga's memory. AMOS Professional is able to
search through this list of headers to find the address of any bank in memory. It starts from the
top, and works downwards until it finds the required bank number. At the end of the chain, the
address is terminated with a value of <b>zero</b>.</p>
