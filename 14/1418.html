<h1>AMOS Professional Run Time</h1>

<br>

<p>
In order for this command to operate, it must be enabled in the Interpreter configuration file.
Also, please note that the current program cannot be an accessory if KILL EDITOR is to work
and the program cannot be a program that has been PRUNed by another program. Otherwise,
for all other programs, the following operations are performed when KILL EDITOR is called:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A "warm start" procedure is executed, saving the configuration of all programs currently in
      memory.</li>
  <li>This configuration and the current program is left in memory, but all other programs are
      erased.</li>
  <li>All Editor buffers and Editor programs are also removed from memory, leaving a run-only
      memory configuration.</li>
  <li>When the program is over, AMOS Professional will re-load the Editor with all of the data
      concerning the last session, which may take a little time, but which will return you to exactly
      the same status as before KILL EDITOR was called!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember that Kill Editor must be enabled from the [Set Editor] option in the [Config] menu for
it to work.</p>

<p>
You are reminded that the PRG STATE function can be used to establish how a particular
program was run. PRG STATE returns the current status of a program in the form of one of
three possible values.</p>

<pre>
<b>Value               Meaning</b>
 0                  The program was run under the AMOS Professional Interpreter
 1                  The program was run under a run-time environment
-1                  The program has been compiled
