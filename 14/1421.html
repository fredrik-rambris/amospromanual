<h1>PAL and NTSC</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Restricting programs to a single mode</b><br>

Many AMOS Professional programmers may decide to ignore these problems completely,
satisfied that their work will not be seen outside of their immediate circle of contacts, let alone
outside of their country. However, this is not a professional attitude, and if you have any
intention of reaching a wider audience with your programming, there is nothing worse than
allowing your work to fall apart before the eyes of an unsuspecting user.</p>

<p>
So, if compatibility problems are not to be ignored, they can at least be avoided. This is achieved
by adding a simple test at the start of a program, which will warn other users of potential
problems, and abort the program if it is run on an incompatible machine.</p>

<p><b>NTSC</b><br>
<i>function: identify NTSC or PAL machines</i><br>
mode=<b>Ntsc</b></p>

<p>
The NTSC function is provided to identify whether or not an NTSC machine is in use, and will
return a value of -1 (True) if this is so. Otherwise a value of zero (False) is given, when a PAL
machine is identified. The following example gives an idea of its use, and similar routines are
essential for professional releases aimed at an international audience:</p>

<pre>
E> If Ntsc=0
    Print "Sorry, PAL version only!"
    Print "NTSC version coming soon!"
    End
   End If
</pre>

<p><b>Dual mode programs</b><br>

Whereas synchronisation problems can be overcome, the difficulties caused by the two different
sized screens causes a bigger problem. The smaller working area of NTSC displays has to be
taken into account at the beginning of your program. To open a perfect screen in either display
mode, you are recommended to save the screen height and position as global variables, which
may be set at the start of a program, as follows:</p>

<pre>
E> Global YSIZE,YPOSITION
   YSIZE=256 : YPOSITION=49
   If Ntsc
    YSIZE=200 : YPOSITION=55
   End If
   Screen Open 0,320,YSIZE,16,Lowres
   Screen Display 0,,YPOSITION,,
</pre>

<p>
NTSC users can easily provide their PAL cousins with a dormant screen area at the bottom of
the display.</p>

<p>
To return the complement, PAL users should restrict the size of their menus, activity buttons,
dialogue boxes, and similar features, to no more than a quarter of the total screen area.</p>
