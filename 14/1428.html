<h1>Memory Bank Structures</h1>

<br>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Bank Swap 1,10: Rem Swap over banks 10 and 1, bank 10 is the new Sprite bank
</pre>

<p><b>Free For_Future</b><br>

This bank is reserved for the future expansion of AMOS Professional. Use it at your peril!</p>

<p><b>"Namebank"</b><br>

This holds the name of a bank. The name is simply a string of eight characters poked into
memory, and it can be changed or altered at will. This makes it easy to create your own bank
types for home-grown accessories. Note that only printable characters should be used, with Ascii
codes greater than 32.</p>

<p><b>Start</b><br>

This is the address returned by the START function, and indicates the beginning of the actual
data.</p>

<p><b>WORK BANKS and DATA BANKS</b><br>

These are the backbone of many AMOS Professional programs, and are used to hold a variety of
types of information. They may be stored either in memory or on disc, as follows:</p>

<p><b>Work Banks and Data Banks stored in memory</b></p>
