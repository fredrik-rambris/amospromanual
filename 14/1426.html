<h1>Memory Bank Structures</h1>

<br>

<p>
As well as this superb new memory pointer, the header contains special flags which tell AMOS
Professional the type of current bank under surveillance. For mere mortals, a name is supplied
in simple Ascii format as well!</p>

<p>Here is a list of currently allowable bank names:</p>


<p>
<b>Sprites</b><br>
<b>Icon</b><br>
<b>Music</b><br>
<b>Amal</b><br>
<b>Menu</b><br>
<b>Samples</b><br>
<b>Pic.Pac</b><br>
<b>Resource</b><br>
<b>Code</b><br>
<b>Tracker</b><br>
<b>Data</b><br>
<b>Work</b><br>
<b>Chip</b><br>
<b>Fast</b><br>
</p>

<p>You are more than welcome to add your own bank definitions to this list.</p>

<p><b>Memory bank headers</b><br>

The header is stored in the following format:</p>


<pre>
Header        dc.l        Address_Of_Next_Bank           * Start-24
              dc.l        Length_Of_Bank + 16            * Start-20
              dc.l        Number_Of_The_Bank             * Start-16
              dc.w        Flags                          * Start-12
              dc.w        Free_For_Future
              dc.b        "Namebank"                     * Start-8
Start                                                    *
*             Data goes here                             * Returned by START function
</pre>

<p>There now follows an explanation of each of the above Header components.</p>

<p><b>Address_Of_Next_Bank</b><br>

This is the address of the next bank in the memory chain. The list is terminated with a value of
zero. Note that each new bank is added to the <b>top</b> of the list so the last bank that has been
reserved will be the first bank in the chain.</p>

<p>
These pointers are swapped around whenever the BANK SWAP command is called from AMOS
Professional Basic.</p>
