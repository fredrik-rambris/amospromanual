<pre>
* The Music part starts here, as a list of patterns to be played in sequence
Music:
           dc.w   Number_Of_Musics
* ".mus" is the number of the music ...
* Repeat for each piece of music
          REPT    Number_Of_Musics
             dc.l   Music.mus_Music            * Offset to Pointer list
          ENDR
* End repeat
* Repeat for each bit of music
          REPT  Number_Of_Musics
Music.mus:
             dc.w Tempo
             dc.w List_patterns_voice_0 - Music.mus         * Offset to Voice 0
             dc.w List_patterns_voice_1 - Music.mus         * Offset to Voice 1
             dc.w List_patterns_voice_2 - Music.mus         * Offset to Voice 2
             dc.w List_patterns_voice_3 - Music.mus         * Offset to Voice 3
             dc.w 0                                         *Free for extension
* We now add the list of the pattern numbers to play for each voice
List_patterns_voice_0:
             dc.w  ""                          * Patterns for voice 0
List_patterns_voice_1:    
             dc.w  ""                          * Patterns for voice 1
List_patterns_voice_2:
             dc.w  ""                          * Patterns for voice 2
List_patterns_voice_3:
             dc.w  ""                          * Patterns for voice 3
          ENDR
* End Repeat
* The last bit holds the pattern definition
* ".pat" stands for the number of the pattern
Patterns:
          dc.w    Number_Of_Patterns
* Repeat for each pattern
          REPT    Number_Of_Patterns
* Offsets to the note values for each voice
* Each individual pattern can be safely assigned to ANY voice
* Simply set the offsets accordingly
             dc.w Voice_0_Note_list.pat - Patterns        * Offset to voice 0 notes
             dc.w Voice_1_Note_list.pat - Patterns        * Offset to voice 1 notes
             dc.w Voice_2_Note_list.pat - Patterns        * Offset to voice 2 notes
             dc.w Voice_3_Note list.pat - Patterns        * Offset to voice 3 notes
          ENDR
* End Repeat
* And now for the note list, one after the other ...
* Repeat for each pattern
