    <h1>AMOS Errors</h1>


    <p>
        AMOS Professional offers several sets of error messages to help you correct your programming
        mistakes. Editing error messages may appear while you are in the middle of programming.
        Program error messages can happen when you test your work. Run time messages come
        complete with their own number code, and they pinpoint errors while your program is running.
        Error messages appear in the information line of your screen, and are automatically displayed to
        help and inform you.</p>

    <h2>Editing error messages</h2>
    <p>
        While you are editing programs, one of the following messages may appear.</p>

    <dl>
    <dt>Bottom of text</dt>
    <dd>The text cursor has come to the last line of your current program.</dd>

    <dt>Cannot delete warm-start information!</dt>
    <dd>You've tried to use AMOS Warm-start system on a Write protected disc. AMOS won't reload
        until the "AMOSPro.LastSession" has been successfully deleted. Remove the protection and try
        again. If the problem persists, you'll have to delete the file manually. It's in the APSystem folder.</dd>

    <dt>Cannot hide the last window</dt>
    <dd>AMOS Professional always requires at least one window on the screen at any one time. So you
        can't hide the final window away as an accessory.</dd>

    <dt>Cannot load configuration</dt>
    <dd>If you've tried to load a new configuration using the option in the [Config] menu, and the file
        you have selected is not valid then this error will be generated. It will also appear in the CLI or
        Workbench if AMOS Professional cannot load the default configuration when it is being booted
        or re-loaded after a KILL EDITOR command. A backup copy of the default configuration file can
        be found in the Extra_Configs folder on the AMOSPro System disc.</dd>

    <dt>Cannot load included file</dt>
    <dd>The INCLUDE command can't find your chosen include file. Check that it's available in one of
        your drives.</dd>

    <dt>Cannot load included file</dt>
    <dd>The INCLUDE command can't find your chosen include file. Check that it's available in one of
        your drives.</dd>

    <dt>Cannot save editor set-up: warm start not enabled</dt>
    <dd>AMOS Professional cannot save the AMOSPro.LastSession file or cannot save one of the
        program files being worked on. This can happen for many reasons - disc protected, no disc in
        drive, disc full etc. If this happens, the next warm-start procedure is aborted and the next time
        you boot up you'll have an empty editor.</dd>

    <dt>Disc error</dt>
    <dd>The Editor has been unable to load a configuration file, include file, or library from the
        current disc. If the file is on a floppy, try re-inserting it a couple of times. If all else
        fails, use DISCDOCTOR to salvage your data and try again with a fresh disc.</dd>


    <dt>Editor command not runnable</dt>
    <dd>ASK EDITOR and CALL EDITOR can only be used by EDITOR ACCESSORIES. These are
        normal programs with a SET EDITOR command at the start.</dd>

    <dt>Editor function not found</dt>
    <dd>You've used an incorrect function number in an ASK EDITOR or CALL EDITOR command.</dd>

    <dt>Mark not defined</dt>
    <dd>This error is generated using the [Goto] system mark and [Goto] user mark from the [Editor]
        menu. You are only allowed to jump to a mark if it's been previously defined from the editor.
        User marks are created by you, but System marks are generated automatically whenever you
        move through an AMOS program listing. However, if you call them straight after a program has
        been loaded, you can still get this error.</dd>

    <dt>No more Redo</dt>
    <dd>You've run out of things to redo. You can only redo lines which have been previously recalled
        by the UNDO command. So every REDO matches exactly one UNDO operation.</dd>

    <dt>No more Undo</dt>
    <dd>You've reached the end of the stored key presses used by the undo option. If you've got enough
        memory, AMOS Professional will happily allow you to undo the entire editing session a
        character at a time.</dd>

    <dt>Not done</dt>
    <dd>This "error" is generated when you abort from an operation such as [Load], [New], or [Quit]
        I corn the Editor. It's also produced when the editor is unable to comply with your instructions.</dd>

    <dt>Out of buffer space</dt>
    <dd><p>The AMOS Professional Editor stores each program listing in an internal "memory buffer". If
        you run out of space in this buffer, you'll get an "Out of buffer space" error. The solution is to
        use the [Set Text Buffer] function from the [Editor] menu to increase the allocation. Each extra
        byte can hold a single character in your program listing. Note that providing you INCREASE the
        memory buffer, your current program listing will be perfectly safe. If you reduce it however, it
        will be erased from memory!</p>

    <p>
        The most common cause of this problem is when you select the "Automatic Adaptation" option
        after loading a large file. This will reserve just 254 bytes for your editing operations. If you click
        on [No], AMOS will automatically call [Set Text Buffer] so that you can expand the memory
        buffer to a more sensible size.</p></dd>

    <dt>Out of Editor memory</dt>
    <dd>You've tried to load an AMOS program which is too large to fit into the available memory. If
        you've several windows open, try closing some of them to grab back a little extra space. Don't
        forget to save any changes first! Also check the amount of available memory with the
        [Information] option from the [Project] menu. If there seems to be plenty of Ram, you've
        probably suffered from a memory fragmentation problem. Save your programs, and re-boot
        your Amiga from scratch.</dd>

    <dt>Out of memory</dt>
    <dd>There is no more memory available to hold the current programs. Using the CLOSE
        WORKBENCH instruction can restore 40k of memory used by the Workbench screen.</dd>

    <dt>Out of memory: Cannot load program</dt>
    <dd>This error is generated when there isn't enough memory to hold an accessory program assigned
        to one of the Editor options. It's also produced by the PRUN command. The solution is to free
        up as much memory as possible by closing any unused windows. If you still can't call the
        program, save any changes and re-boot AMOS Professional from scratch. This re-initialises the
        Amiga's memory system and provides the maximum storage space your AMOS programs.</dd>

    <dt>Please choose a RELOCATABLE PROGRAM!</dt>
    <dd>The [Insert Program] option from the [Editor/Procedures] menu only works with 68000 machine
        code programs in PC relative (relocatable) format. If you've included instructions which move
        directly to a fixed memory location, your assembler will have placed extra relocation information
        at the end of your machine code. This cannot be used by AMOS Professional, so your program
        will be rejected out of hand.</dd>


    <dt>Program already running</dt>
    <dd>This will occur if a program trys to PRUN itself.</dd>

    <dt>Sorry! Editor configuration not recoverable!</dt>
    <dd>AMOS Professional has attempted a Warm-start. In order to work it needs to be able to find the
        "AMOSPro.LastSession" file from the APSystem folder. If this is corrupted, or write-protected,
        you'll get an error when you try to load AMOS Professional. If you've write-protected the disc,
        remove the protection, and try again. If it still fails to load, delete the "AMOSPro.LastSession"
        file from the CLI and re-boot. AMOS Professional should now load correctly.</dd>

    <dt>Text buffer too small</dt>
    <dd>The SET TEXT BUFFER command from the Editor menu will not allow you to set the text buffer
        smaller than 1024 bytes. Try a higher value.</dd>

    <dt>Too many direct mode variables</dt>
    <dd>Normally, you are allowed to create up to 64 new variables while in direct mode. If your
        program is using too much memory, space in the variable table may become restricted.</dd>

    <dt>Warm-Start Error</dt>
    <dd>AMOS Professional has attempted to re-start using the session data held in the
        "AMOSPro.LastSession" file from the APSystem folder. This can happen if you attempt to
        warm-start AMOS Professional from a Write-Protected disc. Remove the protection and try
        again. If AMOS still fails to load, there's probably been a disc error of some sort. So delete the
        "AMOSPro.LastSession" file from the CLI and re- boot. AMOS should now load as normal.</dd>

    <dt>What block?</dt>
    <dd>You've tried to use the Block commands without defining a block on the screen. This can be
        accomplished with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> or [Block On/Off] option from the [Block] menu. You'll also
        get this error if you try to [Print] or [Save] a block. These operations first require you to grab the
        block into memory with [Store] or [Cut]. Highlighting the block is not enough!</dd>

    <h2>Run-time errors</h2>
    <p>
        When AMOS Professional comes across a mistake while your program is running, it will
        automatically halt the program, pinpoint the offending instruction and display the relevant
        error message. As soon as you continue editing your program, the cursor will go to the line in
        your program where the error is lurking. These run time errors each have a special code
        number, which is displayed in brackets immediately after the error message, and these code
        numbers can be used in the process of error trapping. For example, you may want to find the
        error message that goes with a particular code number, by using a line such as:</p>

        command has gone past the last item of data in the current program. Alternatively, there may be
        a typing error in a RESTORE command.</dd>

    <dt>Out of memory (24)</dt>
    <dd>Your Amiga thinks that it has run out of available memory storage space. If the information line
        assures you that there is plenty of spare memory, simply save your program, re-boot and load
        the program back in. There are commands which will free up memory when you start reaching
        the Amiga's limits. These are: CLOSE EDITOR, KILL EDITOR and CLOSE WORKBENCH.</dd>

    <dt>Out of memory (parallel device 172), (printer device 166), ( serial device 148)</dt>
    <dd>If a device requires memory and finds that there's no more left, one of the above will be
        reported back. Try adding the CLOSE WORKBENCH or CLOSE EDITOR commands at the start
        of your program to free up some additional memory.</dd>

    <dt>Out of stack space (0)</dt>
    <dd>There are too many procedure calls nested inside one another. Although AMOS Professional
        procedures can call themselves up, this error may be reported after about 50 loops. The same
        can happen with the GOSUB command. See the SET STACK command if you need to extend
        this limit.</dd>

    <dt>Parallel device already used (171)</dt>
    <dd>The PARALLEL OPEN command can only be used ONCE in your program. If you've already
        opened the printer port with PRINTER OPEN, the parallel device may not be available for your
        use. Alternatively, if your Amiga has several of these parallel ports you might need to access the
        devices directly using the DEV OPEN command.</dd>

    <dt>Parallel initialisation error (177)</dt>
    <dd>The parallel device has refused to open probably because another program is using it.</dd>

    <dd>The PARALLEL SEND, PARALLEL INPUT$ or PRINTER SEND commands have been unable to
        access the parallel port. Check than the cables are plugged firmly into the connectors, and try
        again.</dd>

    <dt>Printer cannot output graphics (162)</dt>
    <dd>The PRINTER DUMP command can only dump your screens onto printers which support some
        sort of graphics mode. This applies to the vast majority of printers currently on the market, and
        includes ANY normal dot-matrix or laser printer. However, if you're using a daisy wheel printer,
        you'll be unable to make use of this feature. Sorry!</dd>

    <dt>RETURN without GOSUB (1)</dt>
    <dd>RETURN can only be used to exit from a subroutine that was originally entered with a GOSUB.</dd>
