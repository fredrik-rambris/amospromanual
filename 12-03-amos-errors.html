    <h1>AMOS Errors</h1>


    <p>
        AMOS Professional offers several sets of error messages to help you correct your programming
        mistakes. Editing error messages may appear while you are in the middle of programming.
        Program error messages can happen when you test your work. Run time messages come
        complete with their own number code, and they pinpoint errors while your program is running.
        Error messages appear in the information line of your screen, and are automatically displayed to
        help and inform you.</p>
</section>

<section id="01-editing-error-messages">
    <h2>Editing error messages</h2>
    <p>
        While you are editing programs, one of the following messages may appear.</p>

    <p><b>Bottom of text</b><br>
        The text cursor has come to the last line of your current program.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot delete warm-start information!</b><br>
        You've tried to use AMOS Warm-start system on a Write protected disc. AMOS won't reload
        until the "AMOSPro.LastSession" has been successfully deleted. Remove the protection and try
        again. If the problem persists, you'll have to delete the file manually. It's in the APSystem folder.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot hide the last window</b><br>
        AMOS Professional always requires at least one window on the screen at any one time. So you
        can't hide the final window away as an accessory.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot load configuration</b><br>
        If you've tried to load a new configuration using the option in the [Config] menu, and the file
        you have selected is not valid then this error will be generated. It will also appear in the CLI or
        Workbench if AMOS Professional cannot load the default configuration when it is being booted
        or re-loaded after a KILL EDITOR command. A backup copy of the default configuration file can
        be found in the Extra_Configs folder on the AMOSPro System disc.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot load included file</b><br>
        The INCLUDE command can't find your chosen include file. Check that it's available in one of
        your drives.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot save configuration</b><br>
        AMOS can't save your configuration file onto your start-up disc. This error can occur if you've
        selected the [Save Configuration] feature from the [Quit Options] menu or when saving from
        the menu item in the [Config] menu. If there's not enough space on your boot-disc, or it's write
        protected, you'll get an error.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot save editor set-up: warm start not enabled</b><br>
        AMOS Professional cannot save the AMOSPro.LastSession file or cannot save one of the
        program files being worked on. This can happen for many reasons - disc protected, no disc in
        drive, disc full etc. If this happens, the next warm-start procedure is aborted and the next time
        you boot up you'll have an empty editor.</p>

    <p><b>Disc error</b><br>
        The Editor has been unable to load a configuration file, include file, or library from the
        current disc. If the file is on a floppy, try re-inserting it a couple of times. If all else
        fails, use DISCDOCTOR to salvage your data and try again with a fresh disc.</p>


    <p><b>Editor command not runnable</b><br>
        ASK EDITOR and CALL EDITOR can only be used by EDITOR ACCESSORIES. These are
        normal programs with a SET EDITOR command at the start.</p>

    <p><b>Editor function not found</b><br>
        You've used an incorrect function number in an ASK EDITOR or CALL EDITOR command.</p>

    <p><b>Error in previous program</b><br>
        There was a problem with the accessory program you've called up with PRUN, or accessed from
        the USER MENU. If possible, bring up the listing on the screen, and try running the program
        again from an editor window. You should spot the error immediately.</p>

    <p><b>Line too long</b><br>
        You've tried to enter a line into the editor which is longer than the maximum of 251 characters.
        If possible, split the line into a number of smaller pieces.</p>

    <p><b>Mark not defined</b><br>
        This error is generated using the [Goto] system mark and [Goto] user mark from the [Editor]
        menu. You are only allowed to jump to a mark if it's been previously defined from the editor.
        User marks are created by you, but System marks are generated automatically whenever you
        move through an AMOS program listing. However, if you call them straight after a program has
        been loaded, you can still get this error.</p>

    <p><b>No errors</b><br>
        No errors have been detected in the current program during the testing process.</p>

    <p><b>No macros defined</b><br>
        If you try to clear macros when there are none set-up this message will be displayed.</p>

    <p><b>No more Redo</b><br>
        You've run out of things to redo. You can only redo lines which have been previously recalled
        by the UNDO command. So every REDO matches exactly one UNDO operation.</p>

    <p><b>No more Undo</b><br>
        You've reached the end of the stored key presses used by the undo option. If you've got enough
        memory, AMOS Professional will happily allow you to undo the entire editing session a
        character at a time.</p>

    <p><b>Not a procedure</b><br>
        You are trying to use the [Procedure Open/Close] options, but the text cursor is not positioned
        over a procedure.</p>

    <p><b>Not an AMOS program</b><br>
        You've attempted to load the wrong sort of program into the Editor. AMOS Professional is
        compatible with all versions of AMOS and Easy AMOS. But you can't load .AMOS format
        compiled programs created from the original AMOS Compiler.</p>


    <p><b>Not done</b><br>
        This "error" is generated when you abort from an operation such as [Load], [New], or [Quit]
        I corn the Editor. It's also produced when the editor is unable to comply with your instructions.</p>

    <p><b>Not found</b><br>
        A SEARCH or REPLACE operation from the Editor has been unable to find your requested
        search string.</p>

    <p><b>Out of buffer space</b><br>
        The AMOS Professional Editor stores each program listing in an internal "memory buffer". If
        you run out of space in this buffer, you'll get an "Out of buffer space" error. The solution is to
        use the [Set Text Buffer] function from the [Editor] menu to increase the allocation. Each extra
        byte can hold a single character in your program listing. Note that providing you INCREASE the
        memory buffer, your current program listing will be perfectly safe. If you reduce it however, it
        will be erased from memory!</p>

    <p>
        The most common cause of this problem is when you select the "Automatic Adaptation" option
        after loading a large file. This will reserve just 254 bytes for your editing operations. If you click
        on [No], AMOS will automatically call [Set Text Buffer] so that you can expand the memory
        buffer to a more sensible size.</p>

    <p><b>Out of Editor memory</b><br>
        You've tried to load an AMOS program which is too large to fit into the available memory. If
        you've several windows open, try closing some of them to grab back a little extra space. Don't
        forget to save any changes first! Also check the amount of available memory with the
        [Information] option from the [Project] menu. If there seems to be plenty of Ram, you've
        probably suffered from a memory fragmentation problem. Save your programs, and re-boot
        your Amiga from scratch.</p>

    <p><b>Out of memory</b><br>
        There is no more memory available to hold the current programs. Using the CLOSE
        WORKBENCH instruction can restore 40k of memory used by the Workbench screen.</p>

    <p><b>Out of memory: Cannot load program</b><br>
        This error is generated when there isn't enough memory to hold an accessory program assigned
        to one of the Editor options. It's also produced by the PRUN command. The solution is to free
        up as much memory as possible by closing any unused windows. If you still can't call the
        program, save any changes and re-boot AMOS Professional from scratch. This re-initialises the
        Amiga's memory system and provides the maximum storage space your AMOS programs.</p>

    <p><b>Please choose a RELOCATABLE PROGRAM!</b><br>
        The [Insert Program] option from the [Editor/Procedures] menu only works with 68000 machine
        code programs in PC relative (relocatable) format. If you've included instructions which move
        directly to a fixed memory location, your assembler will have placed extra relocation information
        at the end of your machine code. This cannot be used by AMOS Professional, so your program
        will be rejected out of hand.</p>


    <p><b>Program already running</b><br>
        This will occur if a program trys to PRUN itself.</p>

    <p><b>Program is not an accessory</b><br>
        You are using Accessory specific commands (ASK EDITOR, CALL EDITOR etc.) within
        program that is not an Accessory. To be an Accessory, a program must include SET ACCESSORY
        at the beginning of its code and also be called from the Editor menus.</p>

    <p><b>Sorry! Editor configuration not recoverable!</b><br>
        AMOS Professional has attempted a Warm-start. In order to work it needs to be able to find the
        "AMOSPro.LastSession" file from the APSystem folder. If this is corrupted, or write-protected,
        you'll get an error when you try to load AMOS Professional. If you've write-protected the disc,
        remove the protection, and try again. If it still fails to load, delete the "AMOSPro.LastSession"
        file from the CLI and re-boot. AMOS Professional should now load correctly.</p>

    <p><b>Syntax error</b><br>
        The current line of your program is written wrongly. You must have the correct syntax or
        "grammar" for the construction you are trying to use, as explained in this User Guide.</p>

    <p><b>Text buffer too small</b><br>
        The SET TEXT BUFFER command from the Editor menu will not allow you to set the text buffer
        smaller than 1024 bytes. Try a higher value.</p>

    <p><b>Too many direct mode variables</b><br>
        Normally, you are allowed to create up to 64 new variables while in direct mode. If your
        program is using too much memory, space in the variable table may become restricted.</p>

    <p><b>This editor command needs a string</b><br>
        An ASK EDITOR or a CALL EDITOR command has been used with the wrong sort of
        parameters. It was expecting a string, but you've entered a number instead.</p>

    <p><b>This file is not an AMOSPro Macro file!</b><br>
        The [Load Macros] option from the [Project/Macro] menu has attempted to load a file which is
        in the wrong format.</p>

    <p><b>This function cannot be used in a macro!</b><br>
        When you're creating a Macro, you're not allowed to call up any existing Macro definitions from
        the keyboard. If you try, you'll get a dialogue box with this error, and your Macro definition will
        be aborted.</p>

    <p><b>This key is not assigned to a macro!</b><br>
        The macro definition you've attempted to delete with [Erase Macro] does not exist! You've
        probably made a typing mistake.</p>

    <p><b>This is not a relocatable executable routine!</b><br>
        You've attempted to use INSERT PROGRAM to install the wrong type of program into a
        procedure. This program file must contain a 68000 machine code routine in PC relative
        (relocatable) format. Programs created with the AMOS Compiler are NOT acceptable!</p>


    <p><b>This is not a 'User' menu option!</b><br>
        The Delete Option command can only be used to delete entries from the User Menu. If you try
        to wipe out any other item, you'll get an error.</p>

    <p><b>This line can't be modified</b><br>
        You've tried to edit a line containing a closed procedure. This is not allowed! If the procedure
        contains normal AMOS instructions you can use F9 to expand the definition onto the screen.
        Machine code procedures can't be listed in this way.</p>

    <p><b>This menu option cannot be assigned to a key</b><br>
        The [Set Key Short-cut] option from the [Config] menu can't be used to assign short-cuts to an
        Accessory program listed in the AMOS menu.</p>

    <p><b>This menu option cannot be assigned to a program!</b><br>
        The [Set Program to Menu] feature from the [Config] menu allows you to assign practically any
        menu item to an AMOS program. The only exceptions, are the various Accessory options from
        the AMOS Menu. These can't be redefined from the editor.</p>

    <p><b>This menu option is already assigned to a program!</b><br>
        You've tried to assign a new program to a menu item which has already been set up. Click on
        [Cancel] to abort, or [Replace] to assign your new program.</p>

    <p><b>Top of text</b><br>
        The text cursor has come to the first line of your current program.</p>

    <p><b>Variable name buffer too small</b><br>
        You have used too many overlong names for your variables. Variable names are held in a buffer,
        and its default size may be changed from the [Set Interpreter] option in the [Config] menu.</p>

    <p><b>Warm-Start Error</b><br>
        AMOS Professional has attempted to re-start using the session data held in the
        "AMOSPro.LastSession" file from the APSystem folder. This can happen if you attempt to
        warm-start AMOS Professional from a Write-Protected disc. Remove the protection and try
        again. If AMOS still fails to load, there's probably been a disc error of some sort. So delete the
        "AMOSPro.LastSession" file from the CLI and re- boot. AMOS should now load as normal.</p>

    <p><b>What block?</b><br>
        You've tried to use the Block commands without defining a block on the screen. This can be
        accomplished with the [Ctrl]+[B] or [Block On/Off] option from the [Block] menu. You'll also
        get this error if you try to [Print] or [Save] a block. These operations first require you to grab the
        block into memory with [Store] or [Cut]. Highlighting the block is not enough!</p>

    <p><b>You should assign a program to this option!</b><br>
        You've called a menu option from the user menu which doesn't have a program assigned to it.
        Use the "Set Program To Menu" feature from the Config menu to install an AMOS program to
        this option.</p>

<section id="02-program-errors">
    <h2>Program errors</h2>
    <p>There is no need to wait until your programs are executed before any errors become obvious. By
        making use of the [Test] option, an automatic check is made of all the instructions in your
        current program while you are still editing. The following messages may also appear when a
        program is [Run].</p>

    <p><b>Array already dimensioned</b><br>
        You are trying to dimension an array that has already been dimensioned in the current
        program.</p>

    <p><b>Array not dimensioned</b><br>
        You must first give an array a dimension before it can be specified in an expression.</p>

    <p><b>Can't open narrator</b><br>
        The file "narrator.device" cannot be found in the current "devs:" directory.</p>

    <p><b>This instruction must be alone on a line</b><br>
        You must place a DATA statement at the very beginning of a line. The only exception to this rule
        is when you define a LABEL.</p>

    <p><b>DO without LOOP</b><br>
        A DO structure has been located without a corresponding LOOP command to end it.</p>


    <p><b>ELSE without ENDIF</b><br>
        You have forgotten to end an IF test with its ENDIF command.</p>

    <p><b>ELSE without IF</b><br>
        An ELSE command must be preceded by an IF command.</p>

    <p><b>ENDIF without IF</b><br>
        An ENDIF command has been found without an IF statement for it to refer back to.</p>

    <p><b>Extension not loaded</b><br>
        You are trying to run a program that makes use of one or more new commands that are held in
        an extension file. Make sure that the appropriate extensions are installed on your boot disc and
        that the extensions have been selected from the [Set Interpreter] menu option.</p>

    <p><b>FOR without matching NEXT</b><br>
        You are trying to use a FOR command, but have forgotten to follow it with a NEXT statement.</p>

    <p><b>IF without ENDIF</b><br>
        A structured IF test must be ended by a single ENDIF statement. This sort of IF test is totally
        different from an IF ... THEN command.</p>


    <p><b>Illegal direct mode</b><br>
        Direct mode only permits you to run certain types of instructions from the command line. All
        program control instructions such as FOR. .NEXT, IF. .THEN, GOSUB, and GOTO are forbidden.
        In addition, you are NOT allowed to call any AMOS Professional procedures from direct mode.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal number of parameters</b><br>
        You've entered the wrong number of values in one of your AMOS Professional instructions.
        You can find the correct syntax using the HELP system. Just position the cursor over the start of
        the offending instruction, and hit the HELP key from the keyboard.</p>

    <p><b>Included file is not an AMOS program!</b><br>
        The AMOS INCLUDE system is only capable of including runnable .AMOS format programs.
        You've probably typed the filename wrong.</p>

    <p><b>LOOP without DO</b><br>
        A LOOP command has been found, but there is no DO statement to trigger it off.</p>

    <p><b>Label defined twice</b><br>
        A label or procedure can only be defined once in each program.</p>

    <p><b>Music bank not defined</b><br>
        The music number you are looking for is not in the current music bank.</p>

    <p><b>Music bank not found</b><br>
        There is no music bank.</p>

    <p><b>NEXT without FOR</b><br>
        You have forgotten to precede a NEXT instruction with its FOR command.</p>

    <p><b>No ELSE IF after an ELSE</b><br>
        The ELSE IF statement can only be used between the IF and the ELSE of an IF..ELSE..ENDIF
        test. You're not allowed to insert it between the ELSE and the ENDIF.</p>

    <p><b>No THEN in a structured test</b><br>
        You cannot use IF ... THEN inside a structured test, but you are allowed to make use of IF
        ...ELSE IF ... ENDIF.</p>

    <p><b>No jumps allowed in the middle of a loop!</b><br>
        You can only jump out from a loop once you are inside of it. You cannot jump into a loop using
        a GOTO or GOSUB statement.</p>

    <p><b>Not enough loops to exit</b><br>
        You have specified a larger count of loops than the number of active loops available in your
        EXIT or EXIT IF command.</p>


    <p><b>Out of memory</b><br>
        During a [Test] operation, this error message may appear when there is not enough memory
        available to reserve the required variable buffer space. Please see the SET BUFFER command.</p>

    <p><b>Procedure's limits must be alone on a line</b><br>
        All PROCEDURE and END PROC statements must begin on their own line.</p>

    <p><b>Procedure not closed</b><br>
        You have forgotten to end one of your procedures with an END PROC statement.</p>

    <p><b>Procedure not opened.</b><br>
        An END PROC statement has been discovered without a corresponding PROCEDURE defined
        before it.</p>

    <p><b>REPEAT without matching UNTIL</b><br>
        A REPEAT instruction has been found, but there is no UNTIL statement to go with it.</p>

    <p><b>Sample not defined</b><br>
        You are trying to play an audio sample that does not exist in the current sample bank.</p>

    <p><b>Shared must be alone on a line</b><br>
        The SHARED command must be the only statement on the current line.</p>

    <p><b>Structure too long</b><br>
        Loops in AMOS Professional have a maximum span of 65,536 bytes. So if you have lines
        between a FOR.. .NEXT loop that exceed this limit you'll receive this error. The same applies to
        IF...ENDIF and all other loops.</p>

    <p><b>Syntax error</b><br>
        The current line of your program is written wrongly. You must have the correct syntax or
        "grammar" for the construction you are trying to use, as explained in this User Guide.</p>

    <p><b>This array is not defined in the main program</b><br>
        If a SHARED command is used within a procedure but the array that you want to share is not
        dimensioned at the start of the program then this error will occur.</p>

    <p><b>This instruction must be used within a procedure</b><br>
        You are trying to use the SHARED command outside of a procedure definition.</p>

    <p><b>This variable is already defined as SHARED</b><br>
        You are not allowed to define the same variable more than once in a single procedure.</p>

    <p><b>Trap must be immediately followed by an instruction</b><br>
        The TRAP command runs an AMOS instruction and automatically traps any error before
        returning to the next line.</p>


    <p><b>UNTIL without REPEAT</b><br>
        You have used an UNTIL command that does not refer to a previous REPEAT statement.</p>

    <p><b>Undefined label</b><br>
        Your program is trying to find a label that you have forgotten to specify.</p>

    <p><b>Undefined procedure</b><br>
        You are trying to call up a procedure that does not exist in your program.</p>

    <p><b>Use empty brackets when defining a shared array</b><br>
        You are not allowed to include the dimensions of an array when you define it as SHARED.</p>

    <p><b>User function not defined</b><br>
        You've probably tried to call a non-existent user defined function from direct mode. Note that
        Direct mode can access any User Defined functions created by your current program. Providing
        they've been installed in memory with a RUN, they can be used with impunity.</p>

    <p><b>Variable buffer can't be changed in the middle of a program!</b><br>
        Apart from a REM statement, the SET BUFFER command must always be used as the very first
        line of your program.</p>

    <p><b>Variable buffer too small</b><br>
        While you are running a [Test] on your program, it is possible that the area reserved for
        variables can overflow. If there is enough memory available, use SET BUFFER to expand this
        area.</p>

    <p><b>WEND without WHILE</b><br>
        There is no WHILE command to go with your WEND statement.</p>

    <p><b>WHILE without matching WEND</b><br>
        There is no matching WEND statement to go with your WHILE command.</p>
</section>

<section id="03-run-time-errors">
    <h2>Run-time errors</h2>
    <p>
        When AMOS Professional comes across a mistake while your program is running, it will
        automatically halt the program, pinpoint the offending instruction and display the relevant
        error message. As soon as you continue editing your program, the cursor will go to the line in
        your program where the error is lurking. These run time errors each have a special code
        number, which is displayed in brackets immediately after the error message, and these code
        numbers can be used in the process of error trapping. For example, you may want to find the
        error message that goes with a particular code number, by using a line such as:</p>

    <pre>
X> Error Errornumber
</pre>

    <p><b>256 characters for a wave (181)</b><br>
        Audio waves can only be created by a list of 256 bytes.</p>

    <p><b>Address error (25)</b><br>
        You are trying to read an odd address in a DEEK or LEEK command, which must
        always be even. Similarly, DOKE and LOKE cannot load these addresses.</p>


    <p><b>Amal bank not reserved (116)</b><br>
        You've tried to use an Amal PLay command in a program without defining a movement pattern
        in the AMAL Bank. These banks are created with the AMAL Accessory program. If you're not
        actually using PLay, check that you've correctly separated any Pause or Let instructions in your
        AMAL program.</p>

    <p><b>Animation string too long (113)</b><br>
        Your current AMAL program is too long, the maximum number of bytes is 65536. You may split
        your program into several smaller sections, and it is possible to animate the same object using
        several AMAL channels.</p>

    <p><b>AREXX device not interactive (199)</b><br>
        This error is reported back by AREXX. We don't know what it means so write to Commodore!</p>

    <p><b>Arexx library not found (194)</b><br>
        You've attempted to use the AREXX commands on a system on which it hasn't been installed.
        The AREXX library is held in the "rexxsyslib.library" and should be normally available from the
        LIBS directory of your Workbench disc. Note; AREXX is provided free with Workbench 2, but
        other users will need to purchase it separately.</p>

    <p><b>Arexx message not answered (198)</b><br>
        You've received a message from an external AREXX program and you haven't answered back.
        You must answer all messages at once otherwise the sending program will be hanging around
        waiting for your answer.</p>

    <p><b>Arexx port already opened (193)</b><br>
        You've tried to open the same AREXX port twice using AREXX OPEN.</p>

    <p><b>Arexx port not opened (196)</b><br>
        You've attempted to use the AREXX ANSWER, =AREXX, or AREXX WAIT commands without
        first opening up a communications channel with AREXX OPEN.</p>

    <p><b>Array already dimensioned (28)</b><br>
        You have tried to dimension the same array more than once in the same program.</p>

    <p><b>Autotest already opened (111)</b><br>
        An illegal AMAL autotest has been defined inside an existing autotest command.</p>

    <p><b>Bad IFF format (30)</b><br>
        You are attempting to use LOAD I FF to load a file in the wrong format. LOAD I FF can only load
        IFF screens into memory and not general purpose IFF files.</p>

    <p><b>Bad parameter (149)</b><br>
        You've made a mistake when setting up the serial port with SERIAL SPEED, SERIAL BITS,
        SERIAL PARITY, or SERIAL X. Check your current set up.</p>


    <p><b>Bank already reserved (35)</b><br>
        You have tried to create a memory bank that already exists.</p>

    <p><b>Bank not reserved (36)</b><br>
        The bank that you are trying to select has not been created using RESERVE. This error message
        can also result from certain commands trying to use data from a specific memory bank
        automatically, such as SAMPLAY.</p>

    <p><b>Block not defined (46)</b><br>
        You've tried to use the PUT BLOCK command with a non-existent Block number. Call GET
        BLOCK to grab some blocks into memory.</p>

    <p><b>Block not found (65)</b><br>
        You cannot specify a block without first creating it, using GET BLOCK.</p>

    <p><b>Bob not defined (68)</b><br>
        You cannot manipulate a Bob without first setting it up using a BOB command.</p>

    <p><b>Bordered windows not on edge of screen (59)</b><br>
        You are not allowed to position a window at the edge of a screen, but must leave at least eight
        pixels between them, to allow space for the border.</p>

    <p><b>Break detected (159)</b><br>
        The device you are communicating with has aborted the present serial operation.</p>

    <p><b>Buffer overflow (156)</b><br>
        The SERIAL SEND or SERIAL INPUT commands have run out of buffer space. Increase the
        amount of memory with SERIAL BUFFER and try again.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot load med.library (187)</b><br>
        You've tried to use the MED PLAYER commands without installing the med.library file in the
        LIBS folder of your current start-up disc. A copy can be found on the AMOSPro System disc.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot open Arexx port (195)</b><br>
        You've tried to open a busy AREXX port with AREXX OPEN. Check that you've entered it in the
        correct format. The name should be in UPPER CASE. You should find a usable port with the
        =AREXX EXIST function.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot open library (170)</b><br>
        LIB OPEN can't find the requested library in the LIBS folder of your start-up disc. Make sure it's
        there.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot start med.library (188)</b><br>
        The med.library requires all sound channels to be unused before it can be opened. So AMOS
        Professional makes a check and if all four channels are clear the library is opened.</p>

    <p><b>Can't fit picture in current screen (32)</b><br>
        You have tried to use LOAD I FF to load a picture into an existing screen of a different
        type. AMOS Professional will automatically create a screen of the right type if
        you specify a screen number in the correct range of 0 to 7.</p>


    <p>You should tag the number of the destination screen to the LOAD IFF command like this:</p>

    <pre>
X> Load Iff "filename", number
</pre>

    <p><b>Can't open narrator (185)</b><br>
        AMOS Professional is unable to find "narrator.device" in the current "devs:" directory, so the
        narrator program cannot be loaded.</p>

    <p><b>Can't resume to a label (4)</b><br>
        You cannot use RESUME label inside an error procedure.</p>

    <p><b>Can't set dual playfield (70)</b><br>
        The screens you are using are not suitable for setting up a dual playfield. The correct screen
        combinations are explained under the DUAL PLAYFIELD section of this User Guide.</p>

    <p><b>Command not supported by device (143)</b><br>
        This error is returned by the DEV DO and DEV SEND commands. A command has been sent
        that is not supported. Check with Commodore's documentation.</p>

    <p><b>Copper list too long (77)</b><br>
        The user-defined copper list has a pre-set limit of 12k. This may be extended using the [Set
        Interpreter] option from the [Config] menu.</p>

    <p><b>Copper not disabled (76)</b><br>
        You are not allowed to use the COP MOVE or COP SWAP commands before disabling the
        normal copper list with COPPER OFF.</p>

    <p><b>Device already opened (140)</b><br>
        You've tried to open the same device twice. The PRINTER and PARALLEL devices can only be
        opened once in any particular session. If you're using multi-tasking, check that another
        application hasn't grabbed the device first. If so, you'll have to quit from the application before
        running your AMOS program.</p>

    <p><b>Device cannot be opened (142)</b><br>
        The selected device cannot be opened for use. Make sure that it's correctly connected, and that
        the appropriate device drivers are available from the DEVS folder of your current start-up disc.</p>

    <p><b>Device error (144)</b><br>
        A device has reported a device specific error. AMOS Professional cannot keep all possible errors
        in memory so check with Commodore documentation for the correct error meaning.</p>

    <p><b>Device not available (86)</b><br>
        You have specified a disc or a drive, but your Amiga does not believe that it exists, possibly
        because you have changed a disc unexpectedly. You can set the directory to the correct drive
        name with an instruction such as:</p>

    <pre>
X> Dir$="Df0:"
</pre>


    <p><b>Device not opened (141)</b><br>
        You've called a printer, parallel, or serial command without previously opening a channel with
        PRINTER OPEN, PARALLEL OPEN or SERIAL OPEN.</p>

    <p><b>Directory not empty (85)</b><br>
        You can only erase directories when all the files held within them have been deleted by the KILL
        command.</p>

    <p><b>Directory not found (80)</b><br>
        The required directory cannot be found on the current disc. List the current disc and check its
        contents.</p>

    <p><b>Disc error (101)</b><br>
        There's a problem with a disc you're trying to access from one of your disc operations, or with
        the AMOS Professional file selector. Try removing the disc and re-inserting it. This clears up
        most problems. If you still can't get the disc to work after a couple of attempts, there may be a
        problem with your disc. You may need to use the DISCDOCTOR program on your Workbench
        disc. DISCDOCTOR should only be used as a last resort, but it's quite good at salvaging dead
        discs.</p>

    <p><b>Disc full (88)</b><br>
        There is not enough space on your current disc to hold your data.</p>

    <p><b>Disc is not validated (83)</b><br>
        This message is likely to be generated when your Amiga is unable to come to terms with a
        perfectly valid disc. Try again. If the problem persists, you may have to resort to the DISC
        DOCTOR program, which is on the standard Workbench disc.</p>

    <p><b>Disc is write protected (84)</b><br>
        The disc's write protection tab is "on". To save your data on the current disc, remove it, slide the
        write protection tab to the "off" position and try again. Alternatively, use another disc.</p>

    <p><b>Division by zero (20)</b><br>
        You are trying to divide a number by zero, and this is impossible.</p>

    <p><b>End of file (100)</b><br>
        The end of the current file has been reached unexpectedly, while the disc is being accessed. You
        should use the EOF function to test for this condition from inside your program.</p>

    <p><b>End of program (10)</b><br>
        This information message is given after AMOS Professional has executed the last instruction in
        your program.</p>

    <p><b>Error not resumed (3)</b><br>
        You have come out of an error-handling routine, but forgotten to reset the error using
        RESUME.</p>

    <p><b>Error procedure must RESUME to end (8)</b><br>
        You may not exit from an error-handling procedure using END PROC.
        Use one of the special RESUME commands instead.</p>


    <p><b>File already exists (76)</b><br>
        You cannot RENAME a file with the same name already belonging to another file or directory
        on your current disc.</p>

    <p><b>File already opened (96)</b><br>
        You cannot OPEN or APPEND a file that is already open.</p>

    <p><b>File format not recognised (95)</b><br>
        The LOAD command can only be used to load AMOS Professional program and bank files from
        disc. Use BLOAD for files stored in standard Amiga format. Use LOAD IFF for Iff screens.</p>

    <p><b>File is protected against deletion (89)</b><br>
        There is an Amiga security command to stop accidental erasure of important system files. This is
        the PROTECT command, available from the CLI or Workbench. You have probably tried to
        KILL one of these protected files.</p>

    <p><b>File is protected against reading (91)</b><br>
        You have requested a file that has been protected from unauthorised examination. The
        PROTECT command is available from the CLI or Workbench, and is explained in the Amiga
        User's Guide that you ignored when you unpacked your computer!</p>

    <p><b>File is write protected (90)</b><br>
        You are trying to change a file that has been locked with the PROTECT security command from
        AmigaDos.</p>

    <p><b>File not found (81)</b><br>
        You have tried to call up a file or directory that does not exist.</p>

    <p><b>File not opened (97)</b><br>
        You must use an instruction like OPEN IN, OPEN OUT or APPEND to open access to a file,
        before you can use it to transfer data.</p>

    <p><b>File type mismatch (98)</b><br>
        You have used a command that is not allowed with the current file. For example, GET and PUT
        will not work with sequential files.</p>

    <p><b>Flash declaration error (52)</b><br>
        There is a mistake in the animation string that defines a FLASH colour sequence.</p>

    <p><b>Font not available (44)</b><br>
        SET FONT couldn't find the font number you've specified in the instruction. These fonts should
        be available from the FONTS: directory of your current start-up disc.</p>

    <p><b>Fonts not examined (37)</b><br>
        You must first create a list of available fonts using GET FONTS before you can use the SET
        FONT command.</p>


    <p><b>Hardware data overrun (150)</b><br>
        This error can be generated if you wait too long before loading your data from the serial port
        using SERIAL INPUTS. If there's too much waiting in the wings the serial port can be
        overloaded, and the system collapses. Possible solutions include reducing the transfer rate with
        SERIAL SPEED, or reading the information a character at a time with SERIAL GET.</p>

    <p><b>I/O error (94)</b><br>
        The Input/Output error message implies that there is a corrupted file that cannot be accessed
        properly. Try again, checking any disc drive connections. If necessary, you may have to resort to
        the DISC DOCTOR program, supplied on your original Workbench disc.</p>

    <p><b>IFF compression not recognised (31)</b><br>
        You are trying to load a screen that has been compressed with an unfamiliar system. Try and re-
        save your original screen source in standard IFF format.</p>

    <p><b>Icon not defined (74)</b><br>
        The icon specified in your instruction cannot be found in the current Icon bank.</p>

    <p><b>Invalid baud rate (147)</b><br>
        The SERIAL SPEED command only permits you to set the speed to certain values. If the current
        serial device doesn't support your value, you'll get this error.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal block parameters (66)</b><br>
        The values you have entered in a GET BLOCK or PUT BLOCK command are not allowed.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal copper parameter (78)</b><br>
        The value entered in a COP MOVE, COP MOVEL or COP SWAP instruction is outside of the
        permitted range.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal direct mode (17)</b><br>
        Direct mode only permits you to run certain types of instructions from the command line. All
        program control instructions such as FOR. .NEXT, IF. .THEN, GOSUB, and GOTO are forbidden.
        In addition, you are NOT allowed to call any AMOS Professional procedures from direct mode.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal file name (82)</b><br>
        You are trying to use a non-standard file name.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal function call (23)</b><br>
        There is a mistake with the values in an AMOS Professional command. Return to the editor and
        identify the likely command in your line of program. Allowable parameters are all detailed in
        this User Guide.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal instruction during autotest (115)</b><br>
        Check to see if an AUTOTEST has been defined by mistake. If it is intentional, you may have
        used an AMAL command such as Move or Anim. Also check the upper and lower case usage of
        your AMAL labels.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal number of colours (49)</b><br>
        You are trying to use the wrong number of colours on screen at once.
        Check the syntax of your SCREEN OPEN commands, or check this
        User Guide for a full list of available screen colour options.</p>


    <p><b>Illegal print dimensions (164)</b><br>
        The PRINTER DUMP command is unable to print your screen with the selected dimensions.
        Check for a mistake in the "special" parameter. This can have a dramatic effect on the size of
        your screen on the actual paper.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal screen parameter (48)</b><br>
        You have specified dimensions using SCREEN OPEN that are not acceptable. Your minimum
        screen size can be as small as 32x8, and the maximum is 1024x1024 pixels.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal user function call (16)</b><br>
        You've made an error in either a user defined function, as created by the DEF FN command.
        The most likely mistake is that you've entered the wrong number of variables in your FN
        statement.</p>

    <p><b>Illegal window parameter (60)</b><br>
        An incorrect value has been entered in one of the WIND or WINDOW commands.</p>

    <p><b>Input too long (99)</b><br>
        Either your input string is too long for a previously dimensioned variable, or you have tried to
        INPUT# a line of more than 1000 characters.</p>

    <p><b>Instruction only valid in autotest (112)</b><br>
        The Direct or eXit commands can only be used inside an AMAL AUTOTEST.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Bad syntax (120)</b><br>
        There's a syntax or typing error in one of your AMOS Interface programs. Use the EDIALOG
        function to find the position of your error in the command string.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Channel already defined (124)</b><br>
        You've tried to open the same AMOS Interface channel number twice. There's a mistake in one
        of the DIALOG OPEN commands in your program.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Channel not defined (125)</b><br>
        There's a problem with a DIALOG RUN command in your program. The channel number
        you've attempted to execute does not exist. It needs to have been previously assigned to an
        AMOS Interface command sequence with a call to DIALOG OPEN.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Illegal function call (128)</b><br>
        You've entered the wrong sort of values in one of your AMOS INTERFACE commands. Use
        EDIALOG to find the offending command. A full list of all the parameter options can be found
        directly from the HELP menu.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Illegal number of parameters (131)</b><br>
        You've typed too few, or too many values into one of your AMOS Interface functions. Use
        EDIALOG to located the mistake, and the AMOS HELP menu to find the correct number of
        parameters for your instruction.</p>


    <p><b>Interface Error: Label defined twice (122)</b><br>
        This is a mistake with the LA or LAbel command in your AMOS Interface program. You appear
        to have defined the same label twice with exactly the same value.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Label not defined (123)</b><br>
        A JUmp or JS command has been entered in your AMOS Interface program with a non-existent
        label number. Labels are defined using the LA command. Unlike AMOS Professional or AMAL,
        you're only allowed to use numbers from 1 to 65536. Names are not permitted.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Screen modified (126)</b><br>
        After an Interface channel has been opened to a particular screen, the screen has been altered or
        closed. Interface stores information about the screen from the start, so you must keep the screen
        in the same format.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Type mismatch (129)</b><br>
        One of the values in an Interface function is of the wrong type. If you're using a variable, check
        that it contains the right sort of data. An Interface variable can be used to store both strings or
        numbers. So it's easy to get confused.</p>

    <p><b>Interface Error: Variable not defined (127)</b><br>
        You've called the VA function with a no existent variable number. Permissible numbers range
        from 0 to 65535. However, the system defaults to just 17. You can increase this limit with a
        simple option from the DIALOG OPEN command.</p>

    <p><b>Invalid parallel parameter (173)</b><br>
        There's a problem with one of the parameters you're using with the PARALLEL SEND or
        PARALLEL INPUT commands.</p>

    <p><b>Jump to/within autotest in animation string (110)</b><br>
        It is illegal to Jump directly inside an AUTOTEST from your main AMAL program. To leave an
        AUTOTEST, use the eXit or Direct commands instead.</p>

    <p><b>Label already defined in animation string (114)</b><br>
        Two versions of the same label definition have been discovered in an AMAL program. All labels
        must consist of a single upper case letter.</p>

    <p><b>Label not defined (40)</b><br>
        You have included a label in an instruction, but forgotten to define it. Check for mistakes in
        computed GOTO, GOSUB or RESTORE statements.</p>

    <p><b>Label not defined in animation string (109)</b><br>
        You are attempting to jump to a non-existent label in an AMAL animation string.</p>

    <p><b>Library already opened (168)</b><br>
        You've tried to open the same library twice with LIB OPEN.</p>

    <p><b>Library not opened (169)</b><br>
        LIB CALL has been used with a non-existent channel number.
        You'll need to open this channel first using LIB OPEN.</p>


    <p><b>Menu item not defined (39)</b><br>
        The item specified in a MENU command has not been previously defined using MENU$.</p>

    <p><b>Menu not opened (38)</b><br>
        The MENU ON command has been called, but no menu has been previously defined using the
        MENU$ or MAKE MENU BANK instruction.</p>

    <p><b>Music bank not defined (184)</b><br>
        There is no music bank in memory.</p>

    <p><b>Music bank not found (183)</b><br>
        The Music that you want to play does not exist in the current music bank.</p>

    <p><b>Next without For in animation string (108)</b><br>
        In an AMAL animation string, each Next command must be associated with a single For
        statement. Also check the upper and lower case of any comments in your AMAL program.</p>

    <p><b>No data set ready (157)</b><br>
        A strange error message generated by Commodore's Serial device. We think it may happen
        when the serial device just cannot handle the incoming data. Let us know if you know better!</p>

    <p><b>No ON ERROR PROC before this instruction (5)</b><br>
        You can only use RESUME LABEL after an ON ERROR PROC command.</p>

    <p><b>No data after this label (41)</b><br>
        You cannot RESTORE the data pointer to a line with no DATA statements on that line or
        subsequent lines.</p>

    <p><b>No disc in drive (93)</b><br>
        Your Amiga does not believe that there is a disc in the drive you want to access. Try again.</p>

    <p><b>No programs below current program (43)</b><br>
        You are trying to BGRAB a bank, but the current program has not been installed as an accessory.</p>

    <p><b>No message waiting (197)</b><br>
        You've tried to answer a message with AREXX ANSWER which has not actually been received.
        You may need to add an AREXX WAIT command before your instruction. Also check that
        you've opened the correct Arexx communications port.</p>

    <p><b>No zones defined (73)</b><br>
        This is an error generated by the RESET ZONE command. RESET ZONE erases all the zone
        definitions you've created using SET ZONE. It can only be called after you've reserved some
        memory for your zones with RESERVE ZONE.</p>

    <p><b>Non dimensioned array (27)</b><br>
        You are trying to refer to an array, but it has not yet been defined.</p>


    <p><b>Not an AmigaDOS disc (92)</b><br>
        AMOS Professional can only read discs created on an Amiga. If you want to use discs that are of
        compatible size but originate from another sort of computer, you will first have to use
        specialised software to translate the data.</p>

    <p><b>Not a med module (189)</b><br>
        The MED LOAD command is only capable of loading music modules which are compatible with
        the MED music format. So check that the music is in the correct format.</p>

    <p><b>Not a packed bitmap (200)</b><br>
        You have attempted to unpack a data bank which is not in bitmap format.</p>

    <p><b>Not a packed screen (201)</b><br>
        The data you are trying to unpack is not in packed screen format.</p>

    <p><b>Not a tracker module (186)</b><br>
        The TRACKER LOAD command is only capable of loading music modules which are compatible
        with the popular NOISETRACKER music format.</p>

    <p><b>Out of data (33)</b><br>
        You may have left out some information from one of your DATA lines, because a READ
        command has gone past the last item of data in the current program. Alternatively, there may be
        a typing error in a RESTORE command.</p>

    <p><b>Out of internal memory (printer device) (167)</b><br>
        The printer device cannot cope with what you've requested. This Commodore internal error
        may vary upon the device.</p>

    <p><b>Out of memory (24)</b><br>
        Your Amiga thinks that it has run out of available memory storage space. If the information line
        assures you that there is plenty of spare memory, simply save your program, re-boot and load
        the program back in. There are commands which will free up memory when you start reaching
        the Amiga's limits. These are: CLOSE EDITOR, KILL EDITOR and CLOSE WORKBENCH.</p>

    <p><b>Out of memory (parallel device 172), (printer device 166), ( serial device 148)</b><br>
        If a device requires memory and finds that there's no more left, one of the above will be
        reported back. Try adding the CLOSE WORKBENCH or CLOSE EDITOR commands at the start
        of your program to free up some additional memory.</p>

    <p><b>Out of stack space (0)</b><br>
        There are too many procedure calls nested inside one another. Although AMOS Professional
        procedures can call themselves up, this error may be reported after about 50 loops. The same
        can happen with the GOSUB command. See the SET STACK command if you need to extend
        this limit.</p>

    <p><b>Out of variable space (11)</b><br>
        Normally, AMOS Professional allocates 8k of storage space for your strings and arrays.
        To increase variable space, use the SET BUFFER command at the beginning
        of your program.</p>


    <p><b>Overflow (29)</b><br>
        The result of a calculation has exceeded the maximum size of a variable.</p>

    <p><b>POP without GOSUB (2)</b><br>
        POP can only be executed inside a subroutine which was previously gone to with a GOSUB
        command. To exit from a procedure, use POP PROC.</p>

    <p><b>Parallel device already used (171)</b><br>
        The PARALLEL OPEN command can only be used ONCE in your program. If you've already
        opened the printer port with PRINTER OPEN, the parallel device may not be available for your
        use. Alternatively, if your Amiga has several of these parallel ports you might need to access the
        devices directly using the DEV OPEN command.</p>

    <p><b>Parallel initialisation error (177)</b><br>
        The parallel device has refused to open probably because another program is using it.</p>

    <p><b>Parallel line error (174)</b><br>
        The PARALLEL SEND, PARALLEL INPUT$ or PRINTER SEND commands have been unable to
        access the parallel port. Check than the cables are plugged firmly into the connectors, and try
        again.</p>

    <p><b>Parallel port reset (176)</b><br>
        Commodore documentation is vague on this error. We guess it's due to a Parallel printer being
        turned off or the connectors being unplugged during transmission.</p>

    <p><b>Program interrupted (9)</b><br>
        You have pressed the [Ctrl] and [C] keys at the same time, to exit directly from your program, or
        used a STOP instruction. This is an information message, not an error.</p>

    <p><b>Printer cannot output graphics (162)</b><br>
        The PRINTER DUMP command can only dump your screens onto printers which support some
        sort of graphics mode. This applies to the vast majority of printers currently on the market, and
        includes ANY normal dot-matrix or laser printer. However, if you're using a daisy wheel printer,
        you'll be unable to make use of this feature. Sorry!</p>

    <p><b>RETURN without GOSUB (1)</b><br>
        RETURN can only be used to exit from a subroutine that was originally entered with a GOSUB.</p>

    <p><b>Rainbow not defined (75)</b><br>
        You must define your rainbow effect using SET RAINBOW before you can call it up.</p>

    <p><b>Resume label not defined (6)</b><br>
        The label you have specified in a RESUME command does not exist.</p>

    <p><b>Resume without error (7)</b><br>
        The RESUME command cannot be executed unless an error has been discovered in your
        program.</p>


    <p><b>Sample not defined (179)</b><br>
        The sample that you want to play does not exist in the current sample bank.</p>

    <p><b>Sample bank not found (180)</b><br>
        There is no sample bank in memory.</p>

    <p><b>Screen already in double buffering (69)</b><br>
        You cannot call DOUBLE BUFFER more than once on the same screen.</p>

    <p><b>Screen not in dual playfield mode (71)</b><br>
        You may only use DUAL PRIORITY after creating a dual playfield.</p>

    <p><b>Screen not opened (47)</b><br>
        You must open a screen with the SCREEN OPEN command before it can be accessed.</p>

    <p><b>Screens can't be ANIMated (67)</b><br>
        AMAL can only move or scroll screens. It is impossible to animate screens using the built in Anim
        command.</p>

    <p><b>Scrolling zone not defined (72)</b><br>
        Before using the SCROLL command, the direction and size of the scrolling area must be defined
        with SET SCROLL.</p>

    <p><b>Selected unit already in use (160)</b><br>
        The unit number can be specified for Serial communications and this error will occur if the
        requested unit is in use. You'll need to have a special multi-serial board though!</p>

    <p><b>Serial device already in use (145)</b><br>
        Another application is using the serial device and has forbidden access to other programs.</p>

    <p><b>Shift declaration error (53)</b><br>
        There is a mistake in the colour sequence used in a SHIFT UP or SHIFT DOWN instruction.</p>

    <p><b>Sprite error (105)</b><br>
        The values entered into a SPRITE command are outside of the required limits. Check this User
        Guide for the correct parameters.</p>

    <p><b>String too long (21)</b><br>
        AMOS Professional allows a maximum of 65000 characters in any string.</p>

    <p><b>Syntax error in animation string (107)</b><br>
        There is an error in the animation sequence specified by an Anim command. Check for typing
        errors, especially for full stops instead of commas.</p>

    <p><b>Text window 0 can't be closed (62)</b><br>
        The WIND CLOSE command can only close windows which have been defined using WIND
        OPEN. So it won't close the original text window.</p>

    <p><b>This window has no border (63)</b><br>
        A BORDER command has been used on a window which has no border.</p>


    <p><b>Time-out error (155)</b><br>
        The SERIAL INPUTS command or SERIAL GET command have waited in vain for information
        over the serial channel. They've finally aborted with an error. Check that everything is
        connected correctly, and that the other end of the communications line is actually sending you
        some data. This time-out limit can be set from the Workbench Preferences.</p>

    <p><b>Too many colours in flash (51)</b><br>
        There is a maximum allowance of 16 colour changes in a single FLASH command.</p>

    <p><b>Type mismatch (34)</b><br>
        An illegal value has been assigned to a variable. The following line shows two classic Type
        mismatch errors:</p>

    <pre>
X> A$=23 : B="A string into an integer?"
</pre>

    <p><b>User cancelled request (161)</b><br>
        The printer was not available to the printer device, a system requester appeared and you clicked
        on Cancel and then this error occurred.</p>

    <p><b>User function not defined (15)</b><br>
        There's a problem with a user defined function created with DEF FN. AMOS can't find the
        function you are referring to. Check that you've defined your function earlier in your program
        with DEF FN. This line must occur BEFORE your FN function actually appears in the listing!
        You can't create your function as part of a procedure, or a subroutine.</p>

    <p><b>Valid screen numbers range from 0 to 7 (50)</b><br>
        There is a maximum of eight screens that can be opened at any one time.</p>

    <p><b>Wave 0 and 1 are reserved (182)</b><br>
        Waves 0 and 1 are automatically reserved for white noise and pure tones respectively. So you
        can't redefine them using the SET WAVE command.</p>

    <p><b>Window already opened (55)</b><br>
        It is impossible to open a window that is already open.</p>

    <p><b>Window not opened (54)</b><br>
        You are trying to access a window that does not exist, because it has not been opened.</p>

    <p><b>Window too large (57)</b><br>
        It is impossible to open the requested window, because its dimensions are too large to fit into
        the current screen.</p>

    <p><b>Window too small (56)</b><br>
        The requested window is smaller than the minimum permitted size. Please see WIND OPEN
        and WIND SIZE for a full explanation.</p>
