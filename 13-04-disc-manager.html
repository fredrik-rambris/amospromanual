    <h1>Disc Manager</h1>


    <p>The AMOS Professional Disc Manager is a highly efficient and extremely fast tool for the
        professional organisation of all the files on your discs. It is ideal for programmers who have
        upgraded to an extra disc drive, and single-drive users will also find it beneficial. The Disc
        Manager is used to reorganise all files from a SOURCE disc to a DESTINATION disc.</p>
</section>

<section id="01-calling-disc-manager">
    <h2>Calling Disc Manager</h2>
    <p>Disc Manager is summoned from the User Menu by selecting the [Disc Manager] option.</p>

    <p>Here is a view of the Disc Manager screen.</p>

    <div class="center">

        <img alt="Disc Manager"
             src="images/1330discmanager.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        The screen has two main display zones, clearly headed SOURCE and DESTINATION, with all
        the Disc Manager control buttons stacked between these two zones. The zone that is currently
        active has its path name highlighted by a red bar, and information about this active path is
        displayed in an information line at the bottom of the screen. If a path name is not valid then
        nothing is displayed in the information line. As usual, all buttons and sliders are controlled
        using the mouse.</p>

    <p>
        Click on either the [SOURCE] or [DESTINATION] headings to select one of these zones, or click
        anywhere in either of the large window areas that display a list of the available directories.</p>

</section>

<section id="02-entering-a-path-name">
    <h2>Entering a path name</h2>
    <p>
        Path names are displayed at the top of the screen, immediately below the SOURCE and
        DESTINATION headings. To enter a path name, click on the appropriate name panel, then type
        in a string of characters for the path name, from the keyboard. If an empty string is entered, the
        current directory name will be used as the path name. To abort this process, press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>

    <p>
        It is important to remember that the path names of your Source and Destination must be
        different from one another, and it is always good practice to give each of your discs a different
        name, to avoid confusion.</p>

    <p>
        At the inner end of each path name panel is a pair of [up arrow] and [down arrow] buttons.
        These are used to scroll into view any lists of files that are too long to fit into the Source or
        Destination windows. Below these buttons are normal vertical sliders, if you prefer to use them.
        A continuous scroll of file names towards the mouse cursor is achieved by using the right mouse
        button.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Parent button"
             src="images/1331parent.jpg" align="left"/>

        You should already be familiar with the [Parent] option in the AMOS Professional File
        Selector. Similarly, each path of the Disc Manager has its own Parent button, to allow
        rapid access back to the parent folder, after searching through its files. To enter a sub-
        directory, all that is needed is a double-click on the folder name you want to open.</p>

    <p>
        A "device list" is displayed by clicking with the right mouse button in the active path panel. The
        available devices, that is to say the equipment for communicating with your Amiga such as disc
        drives, will be listed at the top of the window zone. One more click with the right mouse button
        will make the device names disappear. To select a device for use, simply click on its name with
        the left mouse button.</p>
</section>

<section id="03-selecting-files">
    <h2>Selecting files</h2>
    <p>
        To select a file or a directory, place the mouse cursor over its name then click. De-select by
        clicking again on the file or folder.</p>

    <p>
        The vertical stack of control buttons is used to handle your files. They will now be explained,
        from top to bottom.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="ALL button"
             src="images/1331all.jpg" align="top"/>

        [ALL] is a short-cut button that selects all of the files listed in the active path, ready for
        handling.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Clear button"
             src="images/1331clr.jpg" align="top"/>

        [CLEAR] performs the opposite task to [ALL], by de-selecting all of the files in the active
        path.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Info button"
             src="images/1331info.jpg" align="top"/>

        There can be files on your disc that end with an "Info" tag, and the [INFO] button acts as
        a switch to turn these information files off and on, in the zone window display. These
        files can still be copied even if they are not currently displayed, for example, if entire discs are
        being copied.</p>


    <p>

        <img alt="Size button"
             src="images/1332size.jpg" align="top"/>

        Files are displayed by name, followed by their length, in bytes. If you wish to turn off the
        display of their lengths, for example if the file names are too long, the [SIZE] button acts
        as a switch, turning them off and on. Even if a file name is shortened in the display, names of up
        to 64 characters long are still valid.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Flip button"
             src="images/1332flip.jpg" align="top"/>

        The [FLIP] button performs a major task! It flips over both directories, so that the Source
        becomes the Destination, and the old Destination directory becomes the new Source. If
        you use it now, you will note that the active path stays active after a "flip".</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Credits button"
             src="images/1332credits.jpg" align="top"/>

        Pressing the information button [???] will display the AMOS Professional Disc Manager
        credits.</p>
</section>

<section id="04-copying-files">
    <h2>Copying files</h2>
    <p>
        The Disc Manager can handle any AMOS Professional files with the greatest of ease, as well as a
        range of other audio and text files. To copy one or more files or directories, first go to the Source
        directory and select one or more file names that interest you. Remember, if the files you want to
        copy are currently displayed in the Destination directory, use the [FLIP] button to swap them
        into your Source directory.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Copy button"
             src="images/1332copy.jpg" align="top"/>

        Now click on the [COPY] button. The Disc Manager will tell you exactly how many
        files and directories are to be copied, and it will also calculate if there is enough
        space available in the Destination directory.</p>

    <p>
        It does not take into account any space that might be saved by files that you wish to overwrite!
        Also note that a Ram disc grabs memory when it needs space, so you can ignore any reports on
        available disc space in this case.</p>

    <p>
        Pressing [COPY] again will kick off the copying process. The Disc Manager will create any
        directories needed on the destination disc and then load up as many files as it can from the
        Source disc, into the computer's memory, before saving them on the Destination disc.</p>

    <p>
        If you are using more than one disc drive, the process is incredibly easy. For those of you
        restricted to the internal floppy disc drive "Df0:", your screen will tell you when to swap over
        your discs.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Rename button"
             src="images/1332rename.jpg" align="top"/>

        The Disc Manager is not just concerned with copying files from one disc to another.
        It can perform much simpler tasks. Suppose you want to change the names of one
        or more files. Select the appropriate files using the mouse, and then click on the [RENAME]
        button.</p>

    <p>
        You will be asked to type in and enter the new file names, one by one, through the selected list.
        Press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to halt this process at any time.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Delete button"
             src="images/1332del.jpg" align="top"/>

        To erase one or more files from the current disc, select their names in the usual way
        and then click on [DELETE]. A menu will appear, showing the files and directories
        to be deleted. You now have the following choices:</p>

    <p>[DELETE] erases the next file only.</p>
    <p>[SKIP] jumps over the next file, leaving it on the disc.</p>


    <p>
        [DEL ALL] erases all the selected files, so take care when using this powerful option. You can
        halt the deleting process with a click of the mouse button.
        [ABORT] stops the deleting process, and returns you to the Disc Manager screen.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Make Dir button"
             src="images/1333mkdir.jpg" align="top"/>

        This is a very simple way of making a new directory. Click on [MAKE DIR] and
        then type in the name of the new directory to be created.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="How big button"
             src="images/1333howbig.jpg" align="top"/>

        To find out the size of files and directories, select their names as usual and click on
        the [HOW BIG?] button. You will be told exactly how big the selected files and
        directories are, in total bytes.</p>
</section>

<section id="05-examining-files">
    <h2>Examining files</h2>
    <p>
        The AMOS Professional Disc Manager has been designed to provide the maximum possible
        service with the greatest possible ease. The Manager can be used to examine a whole range of
        different files and then provide you with the opportunity to examine them for yourself.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Examine button"
             src="images/1333examine.jpg" align="top"/>

        Select as many files as you wish, and click on [EXAMINE]. AMOS Professional will
        now look at each of these files in turn and see what category they fall into. It
        achieves this by loading part of each file, and as soon as it is recognised, one of four options is
        presented, at your service.</p>

    <p>
        Depending on what type of files are being examined, you will be able to [DISPLAY], [HEAR],
        [READ] or [PRINT] them!</p>

    <p>
        In this way, the Disc Manager lets you examine the contents of your discs very quickly, while
        reorganising them or simply browsing through. Here is a list of the various files that will be
        recognised.</p>

    <p>
        <b>IFF pictures</b><br>
        <b>AMOS Professional packed pictures</b><br>
        When these sorts of pictures are recognised, you are given the option to [DISPLAY] them. The
        displayed picture will remain on the screen until you press a mouse button.</p>

    <p><b>Object Banks</b><br>
        If you choose to [DISPLAY] an Object bank on the screen, it will appear in reduced size,
        reminding you of all the images stored in that bank.</p>

    <p><b>Ascii text files</b><br>
        Two choices are offered here. You may either [READ] a text that has been saved in this format,
        or [PRINT] out the file.</p>

    <p>
        <b>IFF samples</b><br>
        <b>AMOS Professional music banks</b><br>
        <b>AMOS Professional sample banks</b><br>
        <b><i>Soundtracker</i> modules</b><br>
        <b>MED modules</b></p>


    <p>
        If any of these files are recognised, you will be asked if you wish to [HEAR] them, IFF samples
        will be played at their original frequency as a default, but alternative frequencies may also be
        selected. Music banks will be played exactly as they were saved. When you [HEAR] a sample
        bank, the samples will be played one after the other. If you prefer, any individual sample may
        be selected and its playing speed can be changed. Soundtracker modules will also be recognised,
        as well as most raw samples.</p>

    <p>There are <b>no</b> options provided for the following sorts of files:</p>

    <p>
        <b>IFF music</b><br>
        <b>Amiga Dos executable programs</b><br>
        <b>Multiple banks</b></p>
</section>

<section id="06-formatting-discs">
    <h2>Formatting Discs</h2>
    <p>
        AMOS Professional has been designed to cater for all of your programming needs, without ever
        having to leave the system and go wandering off to much less friendly regions, like the
        Workbench!</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Format button"
             src="images/1334format.jpg" align="top"/>

        Discs may be formatted at any time, via the Disc Manager. When [FORMAT] is
        selected, the new disc is prepared in this logical order:</p>

    <p>[NAME] is clicked on and then the name of your disc can be typed and entered.</p>

    <p>
        [DFx] is used to choose the name of the disc drive to be used for formatting the new disc. For
        example, if you are using the internal floppy drive, select "Df0:".</p>

    <p>
        [VERIFY ON] or [VERIFY OFF]. To make sure that your new disc has been formatted perfectly,
        it will be verified after formatting automatically. This process may be switched off if you prefer,
        making disc formatting twice as fast.</p>

    <p>
        [FORMAT] is clicked on when everything has been set up to your liking. The entire process can
        be stopped at any time, using the [ABORT] button.</p>

    <p>
        A disc that can be loaded and run as soon as it is inserted into a disc drive must first be installed,
        otherwise a separate program will be needed to boot it. Although this can be achieved from the
        Amiga's CLI, AMOS Professional is designed to keep you inside its own system, so advanced
        users are provided with the [BOOTABLE] option.</p>
</section>

<section id="07-copying-discs">
    <h2>Copying discs</h2>
    <p>
        As well as providing you with the easiest possible disc formatting, AMOS Professional allows
        you to make copies of entire discs, as many times as you like.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Disc Copy button"
             src="images/1334dcopy.jpg" align="top"/>

        After [DISC COPY] has been selected, the following steps are taken to make exact
        copies of whole discs.</p>

    <p>
        First, select the name of the disc drive to be used for holding the SOURCE. Next, choose the
        DESTINATION drive, where the new copies are to be made. Obviously if you only have
        access to the one internal disc drive, both of these names will be the same.</p>


    <p>
        Now choose the number of new copies you want to make of the original Source disc. The Disc Manager will ask for a new Destination disc after each copy has been made, until all of you
        copies have been completed.</p>

    <p>
        Select [VERIFY ON] or [VERIFY OFF], as explained above, for the formatting process. If the
        verification is on, the copying process will take twice as long as copying with verification set
        to off.</p>

    <p>
        Finally, hit the [DISC COPY] button, and follow the screen prompts. You will be pleased to learn
        that the AMOS Professional Disc Manager crunches down the disc tracks into the computer's
        memory, to try and save you the time and effort of swapping over discs more than is absolutely
        necessary.</p>

    <p>

        <img alt="Quit button"
             src="images/1335quit.jpg" align="top"/>

        When you have finished exploiting the AMOS Professional Disc Manager, and you
        are ready to move on, simply use the [QUIT] button, at the top of the screen.</p>

    <p>
        Remember that directories can also be changed when editing your programs, allowing you to
        set directories from Direct mode.</p>


    <p>
        <b>DIR$</b><br>
        <i>reserved variable: change current directory</i><br>
        s$=<b>Dir$</b><br>
        <b>Dir$</b>=s$</p>


    <p>
        As explained in Chapter 10.2, DIR$ can hold the directory name that is to be used as the starting
        point for further disc operations, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Dir$="Df0:Sounds/"
Print Dir$
