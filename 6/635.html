<h1>Graphics</h1>

<p>View them now, by running this routine:</p>

<pre>
D> Do
    For N=0 To 34
     Set Pattern N
     Ink 0,1,2: Set Paint 1
     Bar 50,50 To 150,150
     Locate 0,0: Print N ;" "
     Wait 50
    Next N
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
If SET PATTERN is followed by a negative number, shapes will be filled with a pattern grabbed
from a Sprite or Bob image, taken from the Object Bank (memory bank 1). Because these
patterns can be very complex, AMOS Professional will simplify them automatically, as follows.</p>

<p>
The width of the image is clipped to 16 pixels, and the height is rounded to the nearest power of
two (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and so on.)</p>

<p>
The original colours of the image are discarded, and the pattern is drawn using the current ink
and paper colours. Two-colour patterns are drawn as monochrome images.</p>

<p>
If multi-coloured images are required using the original Object colours, the INK must first be set
up, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> Ink 15,0
   Set Pattern -1
   Paint 100,100
</pre>

<p>
That example fills the screen area around the given coordinates with any of the Object colours,
except the transparent colour zero. The colour index number 15 acts as a mask, defining which
colours are to be used, and sets the range from 1 to 15. If the INK command is changed to the
following line, the Object will be drawn with the normally transparent colour filled by colour 1:
</p>

<pre>
X> Ink 15,1
</pre>

<p>
Before making use of sprite images as fill patterns, remember to use GET SPRITE PALETTE to
avoid messy displays. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Flash Off : Cls 0
   Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Pattern.Abk"
   Get Sprite Palette
   Box 1,1 To 319,199
   Ink 15,0
   Set Pattern -1
   Paint 102,102
</pre>
