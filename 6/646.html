<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p>
MENU ACTIVE reverses the effect of a previous MENU INACTIVE command. An entire level or
single item specified by its parameters can be re-activated and the original appearance of their
title strings will be re-displayed.</p>

<p><b>Moving menu displays</b><br>

As has been explained, AMOS Professional menus can be displayed anywhere on your screen.
he display positions can be moved either by the user or by your program.</p>

<p><b>MENU MOVABLE</b><br>
<i>instruction: activate automatic menu movement</i><br>
<b>Menu Movable</b> level number<br>
<b>Menu Movable</b>(single item parameters)</p>

<p>
The default condition is that the menu items at a particular level may be moved directly by the
user. Any level can be repositioned by moving the mouse pointer over the first item in the menu
and holding down the left mouse button. A rectangular box will appear around the selected
menu item, and it can be dragged to its new screen position. When the left mouse button is
released, the menu is re-drawn at this location, along with all of its associated items.</p>

<p>
Use MENU MOVABLE to set the status of entire menu levels, or selected items in a menu
hierarchy, but please note that this command does not allow you to change the status of any
items below the selected level.</p>

<p><b>MENU STATIC</b><br>
<i>instruction: fix a menu in static position</i><br>
<b>Menu Static</b> level number<br>
<b>Menu Static</b>(single item parameters)</p>

<p>
One characteristic of mobile menus is that the amount of memory they use changes during the
course of the program. With large menus or programs that are on the boundary of available
memory this can cause real problems. MENU STATIC can be used to avoid these difficulties by
setting the level or item at which the entire menu becomes immovable by the user.</p>

<p><b>MENU ITEM STATIC</b><br>
<i>instruction: fix items in static positions</i><br>
<b>Menu Item Static</b> level number<br>
<b>Menu Item Static</b>(single item parameters)</p>

<p>This command locks one or more menu items into place, and is the default setting.</p>

<p><b>MENU ITEM MOVABLE</b><br>
<i>instruction: move individual menu options</i><br>
<b>Menu Item Movable</b> level number<br>
<b>Menu Item Movable</b>(single item parameters)</p>
