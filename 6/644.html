<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p>
This is process may take a few seconds, particularly with very large menus, and the MENU CALC
command is designed to perform this recalculation at the most suitable point in the program, in
order to minimise any delays.</p>

<p>
You are advised to freeze your menus with MENU OFF at the start of the recalculation
procedure, to prevent the user calling the menu half way through an update. It may then be
made active again using MENU ON after the updating process is over.</p>

<p><b>Alternative menu styles</b><br>

The AMOS Professional programmer is free to change the display format of any level of any
menu, and design a customised layout. As a default, all titles are displayed in a horizontal bar
with their related options arranged below in a vertical block. Here are the alternatives:</p>

<p><b>MENU LINE</b><br>
<i>instruction: display menu options as a horizontal line</i><br>
<b>Menu Line</b> level number<br>
<b>Menu Line</b> (single item parameters)</p>

<p>
Use this command to change the display of options that relate to a particular title from a vertical
block into a horizontal line. The line of options will now start from the left-hand corner of the
first menu title and stretch to the bottom right-hand corner of the last title. Follow MENU LINE
with the number of the level you want to affect, and make sure that this command is only called
during your menu definitions. The level number can range from 1 to 8, and it specifies the layer
of the menu to be affected.</p>

<p>
It is perfectly legal to set individual items by this method, and with the following MENU TLINE
and MENU BAR commands. This can result in some highly eccentric displays.</p>

<pre>
X> Menu Line(1,1,1) : Rem Display sub-option 1,1,1 as a line
</pre>

<p><b>MENU TLINE</b><br>
<i>instruction: display a menu as a total line</i><br>
<b>Menu Tline</b> level number<br>
<b>Menu Tline</b>(single item parameters)</p>

<p>
MENU TUNE is used to display a section of your menu as a total line, stretching from the
extreme left to the extreme right of the screen. The complete line will be drawn even if the first
item is centre screen. Use this instruction in the same way as MENU LINE during your menu
definitions.</p>

<p><b>MENU BAR</b><br>
<i>instruction: display menu items as a vertical bar</i><br>
<b>Menu Bar</b> level number<br>
<b>Menu Bar</b>(single item parameters)</p>
