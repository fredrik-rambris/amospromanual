<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p>
The second type of usage of MENU$ defines a set of options that will be displayed in the vertical
menu bar. The brackets after MENU$ contain two parameters, the first is the number of the
menu heading that your option is to be displayed beneath, followed by the option number you
want to install in the vertical menu bar. All options are numbered downwards from the top of
the menu, starting from 1. The option string holds the name of your new option, and can consist
of any text you choose. The following lines could be added to the last example above:</p>

<pre>
E> Rem Action menu has one option
   Menu$(1,1)=" Quit " : Rem Ensure three spaces after Quit
   Rem Mouse menu has three options
   Menu$(2,1)="Arrow " : Rem Ensure five spaces after Arrow
   Menu$(2,2)="Cross-hair"
   Menu$(2,3)="Clock " : Rem Ensure five spaces after Clock
</pre>

<p>
That specifies your list of alternatives for the "Action" and "Mouse" menus. Before this program
can be run, it must first be activated.</p>

<p><b>MENU ON</b><br>
<i>instruction: activate a menu</i><br>
<b>Menu On</b></p>

<p>
Use this command to initialise the menu previously defined by a MENU$, and the menu line
will appear when the right mouse button is pressed. To activate the previous example, add the
following lines:</p>

<pre>
E> Menu On
   Wait Key
</pre>

<p>
Trigger the menu and its options now, and use the left mouse button to re-locate the title bar.
Now that this simple menu has been activated, the selected options must be read and reported
back to the system.</p>

<p><b>Reading a simple menu</b></p>

<p><b>CHOICE</b><br>
<i>function: read a menu</i><br>
selection=<b>Choice</b><br>
title number=<b>Choice</b>(1)<br>
option number=<b>Choice</b>(2)</p>

<p>
CHOICE will return a value of -1 (true) if the menu has been highlighted by the user, otherwise
a value of 0 (false) is returned. After the status of your menu is tested, the value held by
CHOICE is automatically re-set to zero.</p>

<p>CHOICE(1) will return the value of the title number which has been chosen.</p>
