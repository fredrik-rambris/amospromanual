<h1>Graphics</h1>

<br>

<p><b>SET PAINT</b><br>
<i>instruction: toggle outline mode</i><br>
<b>Set Paint</b> mode</p>

<p>
This is a simple command that toggles outlines off and on for any shapes drawn using the
POLYGON and BAR instructions. Follow SET PAINT with a mode value of 1, and borders will
appear in the previous ink colour. If the mode is set by a zero, the default setting applies, with
no borders shown. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Ink 0,1,2 : Set Paint 1
   Bar 5,5 To 200,100
   Set paint 0: Bar 210,75 To 310,190
</pre>

<p>
In the last example, the INK command carried additional parameters. These optional settings
follow the usual colour number, and are used to determine paper and border colours. In other
words, they can set the colours to be used for fill patterns and outlines of bars and polygons.
Remember to include any commas for unused options, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> Ink 3: Rem Set ink colour
   ink ,,5: Rem Set border outline only
   Ink 0,8,2: Rem Set ink, fill colour and border
   Ink 6,13: Rem Set ink and background fill colour
</pre>

<p><b>Overwriting styles</b><br>

When graphics are drawn, they normally get "written" over what is already displayed on the
screen. There are four alternative drawing modes that change the way your graphics appear,
and they may be used individually or combined to generate a whole range of effects.</p>

<p><b>GR WRITING</b><br>
<i>instruction: change graphic writing mode</i><br>
<b>Gr Writing</b> bitpattern</p>

<p>
This command is used to set the various modes used for drawing lines, shapes, filled shapes and
graphical text. Settings are made using a bit pattern, whose values give the following results:</p>

<pre>
Bit 0 = 0 only draw graphics using the current ink colour.
Bit 0 = 1 replace any existing graphics with new graphics (default condition).
Bit 1 = 1 change old graphics that overlap with new graphics, using XOR.
Bit 2 = 1 reverse ink and paper colours, creating inverse video effect.
</pre>

<p>The normal drawing state is where new graphics overwrite old graphics, like this:</p>

<pre>
E> Ink 2,5 : Text 100,80, "NORMAL TEXT"
   Wait 100 : Gr Writing 1
   Text 10 ,80, "REPLACE"
</pre>
