<h1>Using Screens</h1>

<br>

<p>
This is the command that swaps over the physical and logical screens, so that the displays are
instantly switched between the two of. them. If the DOUBLE BUFFER command has been
engaged, this process is automatic.</p>

<p><b>LOGBASE</b><br>
<i>function: return the address of logical screen bit-plane</i><br>
address=<b>Logbase</b>(plane)</p>

<p>
The LOGBASE function allows expert programmers to access the Amiga's screen memory
directly. The current screen is made up of six possible bit-planes, and after LOGBASE has been
called, the address of the required plane is returned, or zero is given if it does not exist.</p>

<p><b>PHYBASE</b><br>
<i>function: return the address of the current screen</i><br>
address=<b>Phybase</b>(plane)</p>

<p>
PHYBASE returns the address in memory of the specified bit-plane number for the current
screen. If this plane does not exist, a value of zero is given. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Loke Phybase(0),0 : Rem Poke a thin line directly onto screen
</pre>

<p><b>PHYSIC</b><br>
<i>function: return identification number for physical screen</i><br>
number=<b>Physic</b><br>
number=<b>Physic</b>(screen number)<br>

<p>
The PHYSIC function returns an identification number for the current physical screen. This
number allows you to access the physical image being displayed by the automatic DOUBLE
BUFFER system, and the result of this function can be substituted for the screen number in
ZOOM, APPEAR and SCREEN COPY commands. The PHYSIC identification number of the
current screen will be returned, unless an optional screen number is specified.</p>

<p><b>LOGIC</b><br>
<i>function: return identification number for logical screen</i><br>
number=<b>Logic</b><br>
number=<b>Logic</b>(screen number)</p>

<p>
Use the LOGIC function to get an identification number for the current logical screen, or use an
optional screen number to specify a particular logical screen. The identification number that is
returned can now be used with the ZOOM, APPEAR and SCREEN COPY commands, to change
images off screen, without affecting the current display.</p>

<p><b>Screen synchronisation</b><br>

It has already been explained that the image on your screen is updated fifty times every second.
A single update consists of an image drawn by an electron beam scanning across every line of
the screen until it reaches the bottom right-hand corner, at which point the beam switches off</p>
