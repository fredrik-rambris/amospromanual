<h1>Using Screens</h1>

<br>

<p>
IF you are familiar with the screen concepts set out in the last Chapter, this is where you make
AMOS Professional screens come alive. This Chapter explains how to manipulate your screens,
and we have provided ready-made demonstrations of the techniques on disc, complete with
led notes in their listings.</p>

<p><b>Copying screens</b><br>

Any rectangular part of a screen can be copied and moved on the current screen or to any other
screen, time and time again, at great speed. Copying between the "physical" and "logical"
screens is fully discussed in <a href="../7/713.html">Chapter 7.2</a>, along with detailed explanations of double buffering.</p>

<p><b>SCREEN COPY</b><br>
<i>instruction: copy an area of a screen</i><br>
<b>Screen Copy</b> source number <b>To</b> destination number<br>
<b>Screen Copy</b> source number,x1,y1,x2,y2 <b>To</b> destination number,x3,y3<br>
<b>Screen Copy</b> source number,x1 ,y1 ,x2,y2 <b>To</b> destination number,x3,y3,mode</p>

<p>
SCREEN COPY is the most important screen command of all. It can be used to achieve classic
screen techniques like "wiping" from one screen to another, as well as providing all sorts of
special effects. At its simplest level, use this command to copy the whole contents of one screen
to another screen. Simply give the number of the source screen that holds the image to be
copied, which can be a logical or physical screen. Then determine the number of the destination
screen, which is where you want the image copied to. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Screen Copy 1 To 2
</pre>

<p>
Exact sections of screens can be copied by giving the coordinates of the top left-hand and
bottom right-hand corners of the areas to be copied, followed by the number of the destination
screen and the coordinates where the copy's top left-hand corner should be placed. If the
destination screen number is omitted, the copied image will appear at the new coordinates on
the current screen. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Circle 50,50,10 : Wait 50
   Screen Copy 0,20,20,70,70 To 0,100,100
</pre>

<p>
Note that there are no limits to these coordinates, and any parts of the image that fall outside of
the current visible screen area will be clipped automatically.</p>

<p>
There is also an optional parameter which selects one of 255 possible blitter modes for the
copying operation. These modes affect how the source and destination areas are combined
together on the screen, and are set using a bit-pattern in the following format:</p>

<pre>
<b>Mode Bit    Source Bit    Destination Bit</b>
4           0             0
5           0             1
6           1             0
7           1             1
</pre>
