<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p>
Y MENU returns the y-coordinate of a menu option, measured relatively to the previous item on
screen. Please refer to the demonstration program above.</p>

<p><b>Moving a menu within a program</b></p>

<p><b>MENU BASE</b><br>
<i>instruction: move the starting position of a menu</i><br>
<b>Menu Base</b> x,y</p>

<p>
Use this command to move the starting point of the first level in your menu hierarchy to the
absolute screen coordinates at x,y. All subordinate menu items will now be displayed relative to
this starting point.</p>

<p><b>SET MENU</b><br>
<i>instruction: move a menu item</i><br>
<b>Set Menu</b>(single item parameters) <b>To</b> x,y</p>

<p>
SET MENU sets the screen position of the top left-hand corner of the menu item whose
parameters are given in brackets. These coordinates are measured relative to the previous level,
so the starting point for the entire menu can be set by the MENU BASE command. All levels of
the menu below this single item will also be moved by your SET MENU command. The
coordinates can be negative as well as positive, so you are free to position items anywhere on
screen.</p>

<p><b>MENU MOUSE ON<br>
MENU MOUSE OFF</b><br>
<i>instruction: display the menu at position of mouse cursor</i><br>
<b>Menu Mouse On</b><br>
<b>Menu Mouse Off</b></p>

<p>
Use these commands to toggle the display of all menus starting from the current position of the
mouse cursor. The mouse coordinates are added to the MENU BASE to calculate the menu
position, so it is possible to lace a menu at a fixed distance from the mouse pointer.</p>

<p><b>Keyboard shortcuts</b><br>

Menus are an extremely useful system of selecting from a clear choice of options. They present
the user with a simple method of performing some complex operations, and they are
particularly suitable for the less experienced or younger user. But the AMOS Professional
programmer can be more concerned with speed rather than simplicity, and menu operations
can become a little tedious. This is why you may prefer to choose your options directly from the
keyboard.</p>

<p>
AMOS Professional allows you to assign a keyboard shortcut to any of your menu items, and
these key presses are interpreted as their exact equivalents. They can be used with any menu
command, including the ON MENU range.</p>
