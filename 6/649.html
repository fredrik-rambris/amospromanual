<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p><b>MENU KEY</b><br>
<i>instruction: assign a key to a menu item</i><br>
<b>Menu Key</b>(single item parameters) <b>To</b> c$<br>
<b>Menu Key</b>(single item parameter) <b>To</b> scancode, bitmap</p>

<p>
Any key can be assigned to an item in a previously defined menu, provided that the item
specified is at the bottom level of the menu. In other words, keyboard shortcuts cannot be used
to select sub-menus because each command must correspond to a single option in the menu.</p>

<p>
In its simplest form, define the single item parameters as usual, by giving their hierarchy
numbers in brackets after MENU KEY. Then assign the item TO a string containing a single
character. Any additional characters in this string will be ignored.</p>

<p>
Because each key on the Amiga keyboard is assigned its own scancode, this code can be made
use of for those keys that have no Ascii equivalents, the so-called control keys. Here is a simple
routine to print out scancodes:</p>

<pre>
E> Do
    Repeat
     A$=inkey$
    Until A$<>""
    Z=Scancode
    Print Z
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
The following scancodes can also be used with the MENU KEY command, instead of a character
string:</p>

<pre>
<b>Scancode    Keys</b>
80 to 89    Function keys [Fl] to [F10]
95          [Help]
69          [Esc]
</pre>

<p>
An optional bitmap can also be added, to check for control key combinations such as [Ctrl] + [A].
Here are the alternatives:</p>

<pre>
<b>Bit  Key Tested        Notes</b>
0    left [Shift])     only one [Shift] key can be tested at a time
1    right [Shift]     only one [Shift] key can be tested at a time
2    [Caps Lock]       either ON or OFF
3    [Ctrl]
4    left [Alt]
5    right [Alt]       this is the [Commodore] key on some keyboards
6    left [Amiga]
7    right [Amiga]
</pre>
