<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p>
In this Chapter, the AMOS Professional programmer will learn how to create, control and use
powerful on-screen menus. These techniques allow you to customise your own menu designs
and operations, and offer true interactivity.</p>

<p>
AMOS Professional menus can have as many as eight overlaid levels and any menu item can be
repositioned anywhere on screen. There is no restriction to the inclusion of title styles and
graphic images, and your own Bobs and icons can be used directly.</p>

<p>
When reading your menus, branching to user-selected points in your programs can be
automatic, whether triggered by the mouse or directly from the keyboard. And if you cannot
wait to see all this in action, the Chapter is accompanied by a full range of ready-made
demonstration programs available on the AMOSPro Tutorial disc.</p>

<p><b>Using AMOS Professional menus</b><br>

SELECTING. All of these menus are activated by holding down the right mouse button. Once
the relevant menu has appeared on screen, drag the mouse cursor over the option you wish to
select and release the button. The selected option number is automatically returned to your
program.</p>

<p>
REPOSITIONING. A menu can be repositioned on screen by placing the mouse cursor over its
lop left-hand corner and holding down the left mouse button. When a small box appears on the
menu bar, drag it across the screen using the mouse. To freeze the current position of a menu,
hold down the [Shift] key as well. This allows you to explore the menu without activating any of
its options.</p>

<p>
AMOS Professional menus can be created directly from within your programs, or you may
prefer to use the menu defining program supplied on disc.</p>

<p><b>Simple menus</b></p>

<p><b>MENU$</b><br>
<i>reserved variable: define a menu title or option</i><br>
<b>Menu$</b>(number)=title$<br>
<b>Menu$</b>(number,option)=option$</p>

<p>
To create a simple menu, its title line must first be defined. Each heading in a title line created
with MENU$ must be assigned its own number. The title at the left-hand edge of the title line is
represented by 1, the next title by 2, and so on, from left to right. The characters in your title
string hold the name of the numbered title. This example sets up a menu title line offering two
titles, and you should note the use of the spaces to separate titles when they appear in the
title line:</p>

<pre>
E> Menu$(1)," Action"
   Menu$(2)," Mouse"
