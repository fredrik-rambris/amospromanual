<p>many colours in your artist's palette as are needed. Your programs always begin using a list of
default colour values, and these values may be changed as in the next example.</p>

<p>Remember that only the colours specifically set with this command will be affected, and any
others will retain their original values.</p>

<pre>
E> Palette $FFF : Rem set colour 0 to white
   Palette ,,,,$F00,$D00,$A00,$700,$400 : Rem colours 4 to 8 graded reds
   Palette $000,,$000: Rem colours 0 and 2 both black
</pre>

<p>
PALETTE can also be used to set the colours used by the Half-Bright and HAM modes, and
some superb ready-made examples are available, care of <a href="../6/601.html">Chapter 6.1</a>. For a little light relief, try
his routine, which changes the first five colours in the palette with a hexadecimal poem, and
displays the result on screen. Feel free to change the values or the poetry.</p>

<pre>
E> Palette $BAD,$0DD,$B0D,$FAB,$F1B
   Curs Off : Flash Off
   For C=0 To 4: Ink C
    Print Hex$(Colour(C,3)
    Bar 50,8*C To 150,8*C+8
   Next C
</pre>

<p><b>Filled shapes</b><br>
You should now be familiar with drawing basic shapes and setting choices of colour. The next
stage explains how to combine these skills. Re-set your colours now, by getting rid of any
customised PALETTE commands, before continuing.</p>

<p><b>PAINT</b><br>
<i>instruction: fill a screen area with colour</i><br>
<b>Paint</b> x,y<br>
<b>Paint</b> x,y,mode</p>

<p>
The PAINT command allows you to fill any section of your screen with a solid block of colour.
You may also fill areas with various patterns previously selected with the SET PATTERN
command, which is explained later. Decide which area is to be filled, and follow the PAINT
command by a set of coordinates located anywhere inside the section of screen you want to
paint with the current ink colour. Try this, which if all goes well should result in the Japanese
national flag:</p>

<pre>
E> Palette 0,$F00
   Circle 160,100,50
   Paint 50,50
</pre>

<p>
The optional mode setting can be set to either zero or one. A value of 0 ends your PAINT
operation at the first pixel encountered of the current border colour. A mode of 1 stops the
painting operation at any colour which is different from the existing ink colour. If there are any
gaps in the boundaries of the sections you wish to fill, colour will leak out and stain the
adjoining area.</p>
