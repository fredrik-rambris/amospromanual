<h1>Graphics</h1>

<br>

<p>Try the next example for some simple demonstrations of alternative settings:</p>

<pre>
E> Ink 2,5 : Text 100,80,"NORMAL TEXT"
   Wait 100 : Gr Writing 0
   Text 100,80, "MERGED"
   Wait 100 : Gr Writing 4
   Text 100,90, "STENCIL"
   Wait 100 : Gr Writing 5
   Text 100,100, "REVERSE"
</pre>

<p><b>Advanced techniques</b><br>

Whenever AMOS Professional performs a fill command, a special area of memory is reserved to
hold the fill pattern. This memory is automatically returned to the system after the fill
instruction has been performed. The size of the memory buffer is equivalent to a single bit plane
in the current screen mode, so the default screen takes up a total of 8k.</p>

<p><b>SET TEMPRAS</b><br>
<i>instruction: set Temporary Raster</i><br>
<b>Set Tempras</b><br>
<b>Set Tempras</b> buffer address,buffer size</p>

<p>
This command allows the AMOS Professional programmer to adjust the amount of memory
used by the various graphics operations. You are warned that improper usage can cause your
computer to crash! The address and size of the graphics buffer can be changed as explained
below.</p>

<p>
The buffer address can be either an address or a memory bank, and the memory reserved for
this buffer should always be Chip RAM. After allocating the buffer area at the start of your
program, there is no need to keep on reserving and restoring it, which means that the execution
of your programs can be speeded up by up to 5%!</p>

<p>
The buffer size is the number of bytes you want to reserve for the buffer area, ranging from 256
to 65536. To calculate the amount of memory you need for a particular object, enclose the object
in a rectangular box and apply the following formula:</p>

<p>Memory area = Width/8*Height</p>

<p>
If you are intending to use the PAINT command, make sure that your shape is closed, otherwise
additional memory may be called for, causing the system to crash.</p>

<p>
The buffer area can be restored to its original value by calling SET TEMPRAS with no
parameters.</p>
