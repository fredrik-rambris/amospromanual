<h1>Setting up Screens</h1>

<br>

<p><b>SCREEN TO BACK</b><br>
<i>instruction: move screen to back of display</i><br>
<b>Screen To Back</b><br>
<b>Screen To Back</b> number</p>

<p>
This command is used to move a screen to the background of the display. If another screen is
already there, it will be displayed in front of the chosen screen. Again, if the screen number is
omitted after a SCREEN TO BACK command, the current screen will be relegated to the back of
the display queue. Try this example:</p>

<pre>
E> Centre "Hello again, Screen 0 here"
   Wait 100
   Screen Open 1,320,200,2,Lowres
   Centre "Excuse me, make way for Screen 1"
   Wait 100 : Screen To Front 0
   Screen 0
   Wait 100 : Screen To Back
</pre>

<p><b>SCREEN</b><br>
<i>instruction: set current screen</i><br>
<b>Screen</b> number</p>

<p>
This command allows <b>all</b> graphical and text operations to be directed to the selected screen
number, like this:</p>

<pre>
E> Screen Open 2,320,32,16,Lowres
   Screen Display 2,,130,,
   Screen 0
   Plot 0,0: Draw To 320,200
</pre>

<p>
If the chosen screen is outside of the current display area or is hidden, there will be no visible
effect. However, any graphics will be drawn in memory, waiting to be displayed whenever this
screen comes into view, or out of hiding after a Screen Show command.</p>

<p><b>Defining screen colours</b></p>

<p><b>DEFAULT PALETTE</b><br>
<i>instruction: define standard palette</i><br>
<b>Default Palette</b> $1,$2,$3 ... $32</p>

<p>
It is often necessary to open several screens using the same palette. To simplify this process, the
DEFAULT PALETTE instruction is used to define a standard palette which will be used by <b>all</b>
subsequent screens created by the SCREEN OPEN command. Colours are set using the $RGB
values that are fully explained in the COLOUR section of <a href="../6/627.html">Chapter 6.4</a>. Up to 32 colours may be
defined, depending on the screen mode, and any colours that are not re-set must have their
appropriate commas in place. Here is an example line for eight colour screens:</p>

<pre>
D> Default Palette $000,$111,$A69,,,,,$FFF
</pre>

<div align="right"> <a href="608.html">Back</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;
