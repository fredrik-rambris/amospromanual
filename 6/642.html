<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p><b>ON MENU GOTO</b><br>
<i>instruction: automatic menu selection</i><br>
<b>On Menu Goto</b> label1<br>
<b>On Menu Goto</b> label1, labe12...</p>

<p>
Although this command is available for use, it has been superseded by the more powerful ON
MENU PROC and ON MENU GOSUB instructions. It is retained to provide compatibility with
programs written in STOS Basic.</p>

<p><b>ON MENU ON/OFF</b><br>
<i>instruction: toggle automatic menu selection</i><br>
<b>On Menu On</b><br>
<b>On Menu Off</b></p>

<p>
To activate the automatic menu system created by the ON MENU PROC, GOSUB or GOTO
commands, simply give the ON MENU ON command. After a subroutine has been accessed in
this way, the system is automatically disabled. Therefore you must reactivate the system with
ON MENU ON before returning to the main program.</p>

<p>
To suspend the automatic menu system, ON MENU OFF is used. This can be vital if your
program is executing a procedure which must be performed without interruptions, such as
loading and saving information to disc. Menus are reactivated using ON MENU ON.</p>

<p><b>ON MENU DEL</b><br>
<i>instruction: delete labels and procedures used by ON MENU</i><br>
<b>On Menu Del</b></p>

<p>
Use ON MENU DEL to erase the internal list of labels or procedures created by the range of ON
MENU commands. You are warned that this command can only be used after menus have been
deactivated by ON MENU OFF.</p>

<p><b>The Menu control commands</b></p>

<p><b>MENU ON</b><br>
<i>instruction: activate a menu</i><br>
<b>Menu On</b><br>
<b>Menu On</b> bank number</p>

<p>
The simple form of this command has already been dealt with at the beginning of this Chapter.
After MENU ON, a menu is displayed when the user next presses the right mouse button. If an
optional bank number is included after the command, the appropriate menu will be taken from
the numbered memory bank. Please see MAKE MENU BANK, below.</p>

<p><b>MENU OFF</b><br>
<i>instruction: deactivate a menu</i><br>
<b>Menu Off</b></p>
