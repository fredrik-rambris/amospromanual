<h1>Menus</h1>

<br>

<p>
This command temporarily turns a menu off, making it inactive. The menu can be reactivated at
any time with the MENU ON command.</p>

<p><b>MENU DEL</b><br>
<i>instruction: delete one or more menu items</i><br>
<b>Menu Del</b><br>
<b>Menu Del</b>(single item parameters)</p>

<p>On its own, MENU DEL erases the whole menu. But be warned, once the menu has been
deleted it cannot be retrieved!</p>

<p>
MENU DEL can also be qualified by up to eight parameters, separated by commas, and held in a
single pair of brackets. These values represent the precise position of the item in the menu
hierarchy to be deleted. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Menu Del(1) : Rem Delete title number 1
   Menu Del(1,2) : Rem Delete option 2 of title 1
   Menu Del(2,3,4) : Rem Delete sub-option 4 of option 3 of title 2
</pre>

<p><b>MENU TO BANK</b><br>
<i>instruction: save menu definitions into a memory bank</i><br>
<b>Menu To Bank</b> number</p>

<p>
Use this command to save your menu along with its entire structure of branch definitions to the
numbered bank. Once the menu has been stored in the selected memory bank, it will
automatically be saved along with your Basic program. By storing your menu definitions in a
memory bank, the size of your program listings are reduced significantly, freeing valuable space
in the editor memory. If the bank number you select already exists, the appropriate error
message will be given.</p>

<p><b>BANK TO MENU</b><br>
<i>instruction: restore a menu definition saved in a menu bank</i><br>
<b>Bank To Menu</b> number</p>

<p>
Follow BANK TO MENU with the number of the memory bank where your menu data is
stored. The menu will be restored to its exact state when originally saved, so the restoration
process may take a few seconds. To activate the restored menu, call MENU ON.</p>

<p><b>MENU CALC</b><br>
<i>instruction: recalculate a menu</i><br>
<b>Menu Calc</b></p>

<p>
Any item in an AMOS Professional menu can be changed during the course of a program. This
is extremely useful for designing adventure games or creating self help programs, where
individual menu options can be updated depending on the user's actions. After the menu has
been defined, items may be added and options replaced as you please, and everything will be
repositioned automatically as soon as the menu is called up with the right mouse button.</p>
