    <h1>AREXX</h1>


    <p>
        AREXX is a separate programming language which is included with Workbench 2. It has been
        carefully designed to make efficient use of the Amiga's powerful multi-tasking system. Please
        consult your AREXX documentation from Commodore concerning the intricacies of this
        language, this User Guide concerns AMOS Professional programming!. It will now be explained
        how AMOS Professional supports the AREXX system.</p>

    <p>
        The Amiga is capable of running several different programs simultaneously. Each application
        can have its own memory area and separate screen window, so AMOS Professional is able to
        occupy your screen while a word-processor or communications package is working diligently in
        the background. If there is enough memory available, you may run as many programs as you
        like, and flick between them instantly.</p>

    <p>
        AREXX allows you to achieve much more! It provides a standard communication facility
        between the various programs running on an Amiga, so if an event like an E-mail message
        happens, it can be displayed directly from AMOS Professional.</p>

    <p>
        It is also possible to run one program from another by remote control. For example, a specialist
        word-processor could be called from AMOS Professional, and the current program listing could
        be passed over for immediate editing. The edited listing could then be re-loaded into AMOS
        Professional and tested on screen, in one operation.</p>

    <p>
        In order to fully exploit these features, a lot of memory and a fast hard disc is required.
        Unexpanded machines will be unable to make use of these features.</p>

    <h2>Using AREXX</h2>
    <p>
        AMOS Professional has an advanced internal control system, and a small AMOS Professional
        program is needed to serve as an intermediary to an AREXX-compatible editor. The AMOS
        Professional program can now be run as an Editor Accessory, and external commands can be
        translated into the appropriate ASK EDITOR and CALL EDITOR instructions.</p>

    <p>
        AREXX can be called in several ways. To install it from AMOS Professional, an EXEC command
        can be used, as follows:</p>

    <pre>
X> Exec "RexxMast"
</pre>

    <p>
        The EXEC instruction calls up the resident MASTER process, and loads it into memory
        permanently. Naturally, this can only work if AREXX has been installed onto the appropriate
        hard disc system. Please check your Workbench 2 manual for the required procedure.</p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, AREXX can be run from the CLI prompt with a REXXMAST command. This
        command can be inserted into your start-up sequence, so that it is run automatically whenever
        your Amiga is used. AREXX will now be available from your applications.</p>

    <p>
        It is important to realise that not all programs can make use of the AREXX interface, and the
        relevant documentation should be checked before proceeding. Here is the general procedure.</p>


    <p>Firstly, open a CLI and type:</p>

    <img alt="AmigaDOS Window 1 - REXXMAST"
         src="images/1042rexx1.jpg">


    <p>
        A welcome message should appear. Now enter the AMOS Professional environment and run a
        program containing some AREXX-compatible commands. Finally, press[Amiga] + [A] and run
        the program from the CLI prompt. This program could be an external application such as CED,
        or a purpose-built routine written in the AREXX programming language.</p>

    <p>
        This example would run an AREXX program called Arexxdemo.REX:</p>

    <img alt="AmigaDOS Window 2 - Rx Arexxdemo.REX"
         src="images/1042rexx2.jpg">

    <p>
        When you return to AMOS Professional, you will be able to communicate with the external
        program using the commands that are ,detailed below.</p>
</section>

<section id="02-arexx-compatible-instructions">
    <h2>AREXX-Compatible Instructions</h2>

    <p>
        <i>instruction: open an AREXX communication port</i><br>
        <b>Arexx</b> Open "PORT_NAME"</p>

    <p>
        The AREXX OPEN instruction sets up an AREXX communication port, ready for immediate use.
        Before opening this channel, AREXX must be installed in memory using the REXXMAST
        command. If you are in any doubt as to the current availability of AREXX, its status can be
        checked by the AREXX EXIST function, explained below.</p>

    <p>
        "PORT NAME" refers to the name of the communications port to be opened, and it should be in
        upper case. The name should be less than 32 characters long, and AMOS Professional will ignore
        any characters with an Ascii code below 32.</p>


    <p>
        Before the port is opened, AMOS Professional opens the "rexxsyslib.library" file from the libs:
        folder, which should be installed on your hard disc. The selected port is then checked for
        possible problems, and if it is already opened, an error will be generated and the program
        aborted.</p>

    <h3 id="i-arexx-close">AREXX CLOSE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: close a communications port</i><br>
        <b>Arexx Close</b></p>

    <p>
        Use this command to close an open AREXX communications port. If a message has been
        received via the port, but is waiting for a response, a "Message not answered" error will be
        generated. If you then leave the AMOS Professional program without responding, the port will
        be closed with an error code of 20, which is fatal! Please see below, for a further explanation of
        these error code values</p>.

    <h3 id="fn-arexx-exist">AREXX EXIST</h3>
    <p><i>function: check availability of a communications port</i><br>
        value=<b>Arexx Exist</b>("PORT_NAME")</p>

    <p>
        This function checks for the presence of the named communications port in the Amiga's
        memory.<br>
        A value of -1 (True) means that it is available, whereas zero (False) indicates that there is a
        problem.</p>

    <p>
        AREXX EXIST can also be used to check if the AREXX system has been installed. Whenever
        AREXX is activated, it opens up two communications ports "AREXX" and "REXX", so the
        following example can be used for a test:</p>

    <pre>
E> If Arexx Exist("REXX")=0
    Trap Exec "RexxMast" : Rem Load AREXX and trap an error
    If Arexx Exist ("REXX")=0
     Print "Sorry, AREXX cannot be opened!"
    Endif
   Endif
</pre>

    <h3 id="i-arexx-wait">AREXX WAIT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: wait for a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
        <b>Arexx Wait</b></p>

    <p>
        This command halts an AMOS Professional program until a message arrives from an AREXX
        program. This operation can be aborted at any time as usual, by pressing [Ctrl]+[C] to return to
        the AMOS Professional Editor.</p>

    <h3 id="fn-arexx">AREXX</h3>
    <p><i>function: check for a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
        status=<b>Arexx</b></p>

    <p>
        The AREXX function performs a GET MESSAGE command
        from the Amiga's operating system.</p>


    <p>There are three possible values that can be returned, depending on the message status, as follows:</p>

    <p>
        Zero indicates that there is no message, so try again later. A value of 1 means that a message has
        just arrived, but does not need a response. 2 indicates that a message has been received which
        must be answered immediately with an appropriate return string. This function can be used in a
        loop, as an alternative to the AREXX WAIT command. For example:</p>

    <pre>
X> Do
    If Arexx
     Print "A message is waiting!"
    Endif
    Multi Wait
   Loop
</pre>

    <h3 id="fn-arexx-dollar">AREXX$</h3>
    <p><i>function: get a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
        message$=<b>Arexx$</b>(message number)</p>

    <p>
        After a message has been successfully received from an AREXX compatible
        program, this function can be used to read its contents.</p>

    <p>
        The number refers to the number of the message you wish to read, ranging from zero to 15. If it
        is not included, an empty string will be returned.</p>

    <h3 id="i-arexx-answer">AREXX ANSWER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: answer a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
        <b>Arexx Answer</b> error value<br>
        <b>Arexx Answer</b> error value,return$</p>

    <p>
        Normally, when a message arrives from an AREXX program, it <b>must</b> be answered without
        delay. This command sends back a response to the calling program, with the special result fields
        set to the appropriate values. Typical values are:</p>

    <pre>
0 No error
5 Warning
10 Severe error
20 Fatal error
</pre>

    <p>
        If the AREXX program requests a return string, one <b>must</b> be sent back, otherwise the calling
        program will be left in limbo awaiting a response. This situation should be checked with the
        AREXX function, as explained above, and a return value of 2 means that a reply must be given
        immediately.</p>

    <p>
        The AMOS Professional message system is intelligent, so if you attempt to return a string to an
        AREXX program which does not specifically request one, it will not be transmitted. Similarly, if
        the AREXX program is waiting for a string, but it is accidentally omitted from the instruction, an
        empty string will be sent by AMOS Professional automatically.</p>
