<section>
    <h1>Control Structures</h1>

    <br>


    <P>There is a traditional group of instructions that allow computer programs to make
        decisions. They are usually known as control structures. This Chapter explains how AMOS Professional
        takes (lie best of these traditions and uses them to give your Amiga a logical brain.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-goto">GOTO</h3>
    <p><i>structure: jump to a specified place in the program</i><BR>
        <b>Goto</b> label<BR>
        <b>Goto</b> line number<BR>
        <b>Goto</b> expression</P>

    <P>
        A computer program that can only obey a list of instructions one after the other is a
        very limited computer program indeed. One way of forcing programs to jump to specified locations is to
        use the old fashioned GOTO structure, followed by a target destination. In AMOS Professional,
        these destinations can be a label, a line number or a variable. These are explained in
        <a href="05-01-the-bare-bones.html">Chapter 5.1</a>.</P>

    <P>
        <b>label</b> markers can consist of names that use any string of letters or numbers, as -well
        as the underscore character "_", and they must be ended with the colon character ":" as follows:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "Jump in two seconds" : Wait 100
Goto LABEL_MARKER
Wait 180000 : <comment>Rem Wait one hour</comment>
LABEL_MARKER:
Print "Now is the time to jump!"
</code>

    <P>
        <b>Numbers</b> may be used to identify specific lines, and the program can be commanded to
        GOTO one of these optional markers, like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Goto 5
Print "I am being ignored"
5 Print "I am line 5"
</code>

    <P>
        It should be obvious that these identification numbers have nothing to do with the
        number of lines in a program, but they may still lead to confusion. Labels are much easier to
        remember and to locate.</P>

    <P>
        <b>Expressions</b> can also be used for this purpose, and the expression may be any string or
        integer. Strings hold the name of a label, and integers return a line identification number. Here
        is an example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">BEGIN:
Goto "BED"+"2"
End
BED1:
Print "This Bed will never be used"
Bed2:
Print "Welcome to Bed Two!"
Wait 20
Goto BEGIN
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-gosub">GOSUB</h3>
    <p><i>structure: jump to a sub-routine</i><BR>
        <b>Gosub</b> label<BR>
        <b>Gosub</b> number<BR>
        <b>Gosub</b> expression</P>

    <P>
        Packages of program instructions that perform a specific task can be thought of as
        "routines". When such routines are split into smaller packages of instructions, they can be thought of
        as "sub-routines". GOSUB is another antiquated command, and is used to perform a jump to a
        sub-routine. In fact, GOSUB is made redundant by the AMOS Professional procedure system, but
        it can be useful for STOS users who want to convert programs.</P>

    <P>As with GOTO, there are three alternative targets for a GOSUB instruction: labels, line
        numbers or expressions.</P>

    <P>
        To make sub-routines easier to spot in your program listings, it is good practice to
        place them at the end of the main program. A statement such as EDIT or DIRECT should also be used to end
        the main program, which prevents AMOS Professional from executing any GOSUBs after the
        main program has finished.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-return">RETURN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: return from a sub-routine called by GOSUB</i><BR>
        <b>Return</b></P>

    <P>
        When a program obeys a GOSUB instruction, it must be instructed to RETURN to the main
        program after the sub-routine has been executed. It should be noted that a single GOSUB
        statement can be linked to several RETURN commands, allowing exits from any number of
        different points in the routine, depending on the circumstances. After the RETURN, a jump
        is made back to the instruction immediately after the original GOSUB. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "I am the main program"
For N=1 To 3
  Gosub TEST
Next N
End
TEST:
Print "Here we go GOSUB" : Wait 50
Print "Number =";N
Return
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-pop">POP</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: remove RETURN information</i><BR>
        <b>Pop</b></P>

    <P>Normally you cannot exit from a GOSUB statement using a standard GOTO, and this may be
        inconvenient. For example, there could be an error that makes it unacceptable to return to
        the</P>

    <P>
        program exactly where you left it. In such circumstances, the POP command can be used to
        remove the return address generated by a GOSUB, allowing you to leave the sub-routine
        without the final RETURN statement being executed. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Do
  Gosub THERE
Loop
HERE:
Print "I've just popped out!"
Direct : <comment>Rem No risk of accidental subroutine</comment>
THERE:
Print "Hello There!"
If Mouse Key Then Pop : Goto HERE
Return
</code>
</section>

<section id="01-decision-making">
    <h2>Decision making</h2>

    <p>The command words used in the decision making process have very similar meanings in
        AMOS Professional as they do in normal English.</P>


    <h3 class="command" id="str-if">IF</h3>
    <h3 class="command" id="str-then">THEN</h3>
    <P><i>structure: choose between alternative actions</i><BR>
    <b>If</b> conditions <b>Then</b> statements</P>

    <P>
        The IF ... THEN structure allows simple decisions to be made within a program, so IF a condition
        is true THEN the computer decides to take a particular course of action. If the condition
        is not true, the machine does something else. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">NIGHT=12
DAY=12
Print "What time is it now?" : Wait 150
If NIGHT=DAY Then Goto BED
Print "Time I bought a watch"
Goto WATCHMAKER
BED:
Print "I think it is bed time"
WATCHMAKER:
</code>


    <h3 class="command" id="str-and">AND</h3>
    <h3 class="command" id="str-or">OR</h3>
    <P><i>structures: qualify a condition</i><BR>
        <b>If</b> condition <b>And</b> condition <b>Then</b> statement<BR>
        <b>If</b> condition <b>Or</b> condition <b>Then</b> statement</P>

    <P>
        The list of condition; in an IF ... THEN structure can be any list of tests, including AND
        and OR. Try changing the conditions of the last example with either of the following lines:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">If NIGHT=DAY And NIGHT&lt;&gt;12 Then Goto BED</code>
<br>
<code class="prefix edit">If NIGHT&lt;DAY Or NIGHT=12 Then Edit</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-else">ELSE</h3>
    <p><i>structure: qualify a condition</i><BR>
        <b>If</b> condition <b>Then</b> statement1 <b>Else</b> statement2</P>

    <P>ELSE is also understood when making decisions, as to what action should be taken,
        depending on conditions. So the last example could be changed to something like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">If NIGHT+1=DAY Then Goto BED Else Shoot</code>

    <P>
        The alternative choice of statements in this sort of structure must be a list of one or
        more AMOS Professional instructions. Also remember to include a separate GOTO command if you want to
        jump to a label or a numbered line, otherwise the label will be treated as a procedure
        name and it could possibly generate an error. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">If NIGHT=1 Then Goto BED: <comment>Rem This is perfect</comment></code>
<br>
<code class="prefix ex">If NIGHT=1 Then BED: <comment>Rem This looks for a BED procedure</comment></code>

    <P>
        An IF ... THEN statement is limited to a single line, of a listing, which is not very
        satisfactory to an AMOS Professional programmer. This technique has been superseded by a "structured test",
        where IF is used to trigger off a whole range of instructions, depending on the outcome of
        a single decision.</P>
</section>

<section id="02-structured-tests">
    <h2>Structured tests</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-end-if">END IF</h3>
    <p><i>structure: terminate a structured test</i><BR>
        <b>If</b> structured test <b>End If</b></P>

    <P>
        In a structured test, each test is set up with an IF and ended with a matching END IF,
        but under no circumstances can a THEN be used anywhere inside such a test! The statements in a
        structured test are separated by colons on any particular line, as usual, but can extend
        over any number of lines in your listing, as required. Look at this old fashioned schematic line:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">If condition=true Then Goto Label1 Else Label2</code>

    <P>This may now be replaced by the alternative structured test format:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">If condition=true : Goto Label1 : Else Goto Label2 : End If</code>

    <P>Here is a working example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Input "Type values A,B and C: ";A,B,C
If A=B
   Print "A equals B";
Else
   Print "A is not equal to B";
   If A&lt;&gt;B And A&lt;&gt;C
      Print "or to C"
   End If
End If
</code>

    <P>Note how each IF statement must be paired with a single END IF to inform AMOS
        Professional exactly which group of instructions is to be executed inside the test.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-else-if">ELSE IF</h3>
    <p><i>structure: allow multiple structured tests</i><BR>
        <b>If</b> condition <b>Else If</b> multiple conditions ... <b>Else</b> statement <b>End If</b></P>

    <P>
        This allows multiple tests to be performed. ELSE IF must be used within a normal IF ...
        END IF statement, and the only rule to remember is that there must be one ELSE just before the
        END IF. This sort of test waits for an expression, and if the expression is True, then what comes
        after it is executed. Here is an example:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">If A=1
   Print "A=1"
Else If A=2
   Print "A=2"
Else If A=3
   Print "A=3"
Else
   Print "Something Else"
End If
</code>

    <P>If necessary, an entire test can be placed in a single line, as follows:</P>
<code class="prefix ex">If A=1 : Print "A=1" : Else If A=2 : Print "A=2" : Else : Print "Something Else" : End If<BR></code>

    <P>
        When taking logical decisions, your Amiga understands the following character symbols, which
        are used as a form of short-hand:</P>

    <PRE>
<b>Symbol  Meaning</b>
=       equal to
&lt;&gt;      not equal to
&gt;       greater than
&gt;       less than
&gt;=      greater than or equal to
&lt;=      less than or equal to
</PRE>

    <P>There are also three functions that can be called during the decision making process.</P>


    <h3 class="command" id="fn-true">TRUE</h3>
    <h3 class="command" id="fn-false">FALSE</h3>
    <P><i>functions: hold value of -1 (True) and zero (False)</i><BR>
        value=<b>True</b><BR>
        value=<b>False</b></P>

    <P>
        In all the conditional operations such as IF ... THEN and REPEAT ... UNTIL, the value
        of -1 is used to represent TRUE, and the value of 0 is used to represent FALSE. A value of either
        -1 (True) or 0 (False) is produced every time a test is made to satisfy a condition.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-not">NOT</h3>
    <p><i>structure: toggle binary digits</i><BR>
        value=<b>Not</b> digits</P>

    <P>NOT is used to swap over every digit in a binary number from a 0 to a 1, and vice
        versa. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print Bin$(Not%11110000,8)</code>

    <P>Since -1 (True) can be expressed in binary as %1111111111111111, then NOT TRUE must be
        equal to FALSE, and a logical NOT operation is achieved.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-swap">SWAP</h3>
    <p><i>structure: swap the contents of two variables</i><BR>
        <b>Swap</b> a,b<BR>
        <b>Swap</b> a#,b#<BR>
        <b>Swap</b> a$,b$</P>

    <P>Use the SWAP command to swap over the data between any two variables of the same type.
        For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">A=10 : B=99: Print A,B
Swap A,B : Print A,B
</code>

<section id="03-using-loops">
    <h2>Using loops</h2>

    <p>To write a separate routine for dozens of logical choices, and to end up with dozens of
        END IFs is not only messy, but also extremely tedious. AMOS Professional offers all of the
        expected programming short-cuts to allow sections of code to be repeated as often as necessary.
        These repeated parts of programs are known as "loops".</P>


    <h3 class="command" id="str-do">DO</h3>
    <h3 class="command" id="str-loop">LOOP</h3>
    <P><i>structure: keep repeating a list of statements</i><BR>
        <b>Do</b><BR>
        list of statements<BR>
        <b>Loop</b></P>

    <P>
        This pair of commands will loop a list of AMOS Professional statements forever, with DO
        acting as the marker position for the LOOP to return to. Both the DO and LOOP should occupy their
        own lines, as follows:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Do
 Print "FOREVER AND": Wait 25
Loop
</code>


    <h3 class="command" id="str-exit">EXIT</h3>
    <P><i>structure: break out of a loop</i><br>
        <b>Exit</b><br>
        <b>Exit</b> number</p>

    <P>
        EXIT forces the program to leave a loop immediately, and it can be used to escape from
        all the types of loop employed in AMOS Professional, such as FOR ... NEXT, REPEAT ... UNTIL,
        WHILE ... WEND and DO ... LOOP. Any number of loops may be nested inside of one another,
        and when used on its own, EXIT will short-circuit the innermost loop only. By including an
        optional number after EXIT, that number of nested loops will be taken into account before
        the EXIT is made, and the program will jump directly to the instruction immediately after the
        relevant loop.</P>

    <P>For example:</P>

    <pre>
E&gt; Do
    Do
     Input "Type in a number";X
     Print "I am the inner loop"
     If X=1 Then Exit
     If X=2 Then Exit 2
    Loop
    Print "I am the outer loop"
   Loop
   Print "And I am outside both loops!"
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-exit-if">EXIT IF</h3>
    <p><i>structure: exit from a loop depending on a test</i><BR>
        <b>Exit If</b> expression<BR>
        <b>Exit If</b> expression,number</P>


    <P>
        It is often necessary to leave a loop as a result of a specific set of conditions, and
        this can be simplified by using the EXIT IF instruction. As explained above, in conditional operations,
        the value -1 represents True, whereas a zero represents False. After using EXIT IF, an
        expression is given which consists of one or more tests in standard AMOS Professional format. The EXIT
        will only be performed IF the result is found to be -1 (True).</P>

    <P>
        As before, an optional number can be given to specify the number of loops to be jumped
        from, otherwise only the current loop will be aborted. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edti">While L=0
 A=0
 Do
  A=A+1
  For X=0 To 100
   Exit If A=10,2 : <comment>Rem Exit from DO and FOR loops</comment>
  Next X
 Loop
 Exit 1: <comment>Rem Exit from WHILE loop</comment>
Wend

<section id="04-conditional-loops">
    <h2>Conditional loops</h2>


        <h3 class="command" id="str-while">WHILE</h3>
        <h3 class="command" id="str-wend">WEND</h3>
        <P><i>structure: repeat loop while condition is true</i><BR>
        <b>While</b> condition<BR>
        list of statements<BR>
        <b>Wend</b></P>

    <P>
        This pair of commands provides a convenient way of making the program repeat a group of
        instructions all the time a particular condition is true. WHILE marks the start of this
        loop, and the condition is checked for a value of -1 (True) from this starting position through to
        the end position, which is marked by a WEND. The condition is then checked again at every turn of
        the loop, until it is no longer true. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">BLAZES:
Print "Please type in the number 9"
Input X
 While X=9
  Cls : Print X : Wait 50 : Goto BLAZES
 Wend
Print "That is not a 9!"
</code>

    <P>You are free to use AND, OR and NOT to qualify the conditions to be checked.</P>


        <h3 class="command" id="str-repeat">REPEAT</h3>
        <h3 class="command" id="str-until">UNTIL</h3>
        <P><i>structure: repeat loop until a condition is satisfied</i><BR>
        <b>Repeat</b><BR>
        list of statements<BR>
        <b>Until</b> condition</P>

    <P>
        Unlike that last example, instead of checking if a condition is true or false at the start
        of a loop, the pair of commands makes its check at the end of a loop. REPEAT marks the start and
        UNTIL the end of the loop to be checked. This means that if a condition is false at the
        beginning of a</P>

    <P>
        WHILE ... WEND structure, that loop will never be performed at all, but if it is true
        at the beginning of a REPEAT ... UNTIL structure, the loop will be performed at least once. Here
        is an example that waits for you to press a mouse button:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Repeat
 Print "I can go on forever" : Wait 25
Until Mouse Key&lt;&gt;0
</code>
</section>

<section id="05-controlled-loops">
    <h2>Controlled loops</h2>

    <p>When deciding how many times a loop is to be repeated, control can be made much more
        definite than relying on whether conditions are true or false.</P>


        <h3 class="command" id="str-for">FOR</h3>
        <h3 class="command" id="str-to">TO</h3>
        <h3 class="command" id="str-next">NEXT</h3>

        <b>For</b> index=first number <b>To</b> last number<BR>
        list of statements<BR>
        <b>Next</b> index</P>

    <P>
        This control structure is one of the programmer's classic devices. Each FOR statement
        must be matched by a single NEXT, and pairs of FOR ... NEXT loops can be nested inside one
        another. Each loop repeats a list of instructions for a specific number of times, governed by an
        index which counts the number of times the loop is repeated. Once inside the loop, this index
        can be read by the program as if it is a normal variable. Here is a simple example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">For X=1 To 7
 Print "SEVEN DEADLY SINS"
Next X
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-step">STEP</h3>
    <p><i>structure: control increment of index in a loop</i><BR>
        <b>For</b> index=first number <b>To</b> last number <b>Step</b> size</P>

    <P>Normally, the index counter is increased by 1 unit at every turn of a FOR ... NEXT
        loop. When the current value exceeds that of the last number specified, the loop is terminated. For
        example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">For DAY=1 To 365
 Print DAY
Next DAY
</code>

    <P>STEP is used to change the size of increase in the index value, like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">For DAY=1 To 365 Step 7
 Print DAY
Next DAY
</code>

<section id="06-forced-jumps">
    <h2>Forced jumps</h2>

    <p>So far, it has been explained how certain jumps are made to another part of a program by logical
        decisions based on whether a situation is true or false. Similar jumps can be made whenever a
        particular variable is recognised, in other words, regardless of any other conditions. GOTO and
        GOSUB are examples of a "forced" jump.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-on">ON</h3>
    <p><i>structure: jump on recognising a variable</i><BR>
        <b>On</b> variable <b>Proc</b> list of procedures<BR>
        <b>On</b> variable <b>Goto</b> list of numbered lines or labels<BR>
        <b>On</b> variable <b>Gosub</b> list of numbered lines or labels</p>


    <P>
        ON can be used to force the program to jump to a pre-defined position when it
        recognises a specified variable. Furthermore, jumps can be made to a choice of several positions,
        depending on what value is held by the variable at the time it is spotted. ON can force a jump to
        any of the following structures.</P>

    <P><b>Procedures</b>. When using an ON ... PROC structure, one or more named procedures is used
        as the target destination for a jump, depending on the contents currently held by a variable.
        Look at the following line:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">On X Proc PROCEDURE1,PROCEDURE2</code>

    <P>That is exactly the same as saying:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">If X=1 Then PROCEDURE1
If X=2 Then PROCEDURE2
</code>

    <P>
        It is important to note that procedures used in this way cannot include any parameters.
        If information is to be transferred to the procedure, it should be placed in a <b>global</b>
        variable, as explained in <a href="05-05-procedures.html">Chapter 5.5</a>.</P>

    <P><b>Goto</b> is used to jump to one of a list of numbered lines, or a label, depending on the
        result of an expression. For example:</P>

    <pre>
E&gt; Print "Type in a value from 1 to 3"
   Input X
   On X Goto LABEL1,LABEL2,LABEL3
   LABEL1:
   Print "Ready"
   LABEL2:
   Print "Steady"
   LABEL3:
   Print "Go!"
</pre>

    <p>
        For that to work properly, X must have a value from 1 up to the number of the highest
        possible destination. Any other values would cause problems. In fact the third line of that example
        is a very economical way of writing the following lines:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">If X=1 Then Goto LABEL1
If X=2 Then Goto LABEL2
If X=3 Then Goto LABEL3
</code>

    <P>Now change the third line of the last example to this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">On X Goto LABEL3,LABEL2,LABEL1</code>

    <P>
        Gosub. The use of an ON GOSUB structure is identical to ON ... GOTO, except that it
        must employ a RETURN to jump back to the instruction immediately after the ON ... GOSUB
        statement. Destinations may be given as the name of a label, or the identification number
        of a line between 1 and the maximum number of possible destinations.</P>

    <P>ON is also used with the ON BREAK PROC structure, as well as ON ERROR GOTO, which are
        explained in the relevant sections of the Procedures and Error Handling Chapters of this
        User Guide.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-every">EVERY</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: call subroutine or procedure at regular intervals</i><BR>
        <b>Every</b> time <b>Gosub</b> label<BR>
        <b>Every</b> time <b>Proc</b> name</P>

    <P>The EVERY statement is used to call up a sub-routine or a procedure at regular
        intervals,
        without interfering with the main program. Simply specify the length of time between every
        call, measured in 50ths of a second. Obviously the time taken for a sub-routine or a
        procedure to
        be completed must be less than the interval time, or an error will be generated.</P>

    <P>After a sub-routine has been entered, the EVERY system is automatically disabled. This
        means
        that in order to call this feature continuously, an EVERY ON command must be inserted into
        a sub-routine before the final RETURN statement. Similarly, EVERY ON must be included in a
        procedure before returning to the main program with an END PROC. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Every 50 Proc TEST
Do
  Print At(0,0); "Main Loop"
Loop
Procedure TEST
  Shared A
  Inc A: Print "This is call number ";A
  Every On
End Proc
</code>


        <h3 class="command" id="i-every-on">EVERY ON</h3>
        <h3 class="command" id="i-every-off">EVERY OFF</h3>
        <P><i>instruction: toggle regular EVERY calls</i><BR>
        <b>Every On</b><BR>
        <b>Every Off</b></P>

    <P>
        As explained, EVERY ON should be used before the relevant sub-routine or procedure has
        finished executing. EVERY OFF is the default condition, and is used to disable the
        automatic calling process altogether.</P>

    <h2>Handling data</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-data">DATA</h3>
    <p><i>structure: place a list of data items in a program</i><BR>
        <b>Data</b> list</P>

    <P>A DATA statement lets you include whole lists of useful information in your programs.
        Each item in the list must be separated by a comma, like this:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">Data 1,2,3,4</code>

    <P>Also each DATA instruction must be the only statement on the current line, because
        anything that follows it will be ignored! Prove that with the following line:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Read A$: Print A$
Data "I am legal" : Print "But I am not!"
</code>

    <P>Data can be "read" into one or more variables, and unlike many Basic languages, AMOS
        Professional allows you to include expressions as part of your data. So the following
        lines of code are all equally acceptable:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">Data $FF50,$890
Data %11111111,%110011010110
Data A
Label: Data A+3/2.0-Sin(B)
Data "AMOS"+"Professional"
</code>

    <P>Examine those lines, and note that the A at Label will be input as the contents of
        variable A, and not the character A. The expression will be evaluated using the latest value of A.</P>

    <P>
        Data statements may be placed at any position in your program, but any data stored
        inside an AMOS Professional procedure will not be accessible from the main program. Each procedure
        can have its own individual set of data statements, which are completely independent from
        the rest of the program.</P>

    <!-- section -->

    <P> For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">EXAMPLE
Read A$: Print A$
Data "I am Main Program Data"
Procedure EXAMPLE
 Read B$: Print B$
 Data "I am Procedure Data only"
End Proc
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-read">READ</h3>
    <p><i>structure: read data into a variable</i><BR>
        <b>Read</b> list</P>

    <P>
        When READ loads items of information that have been stored in a DATA statement into a
        list of variables, it uses a special marker to jump to the first item in the first DATA statement
        of your listing. As soon as that item of data has been read, the marker moves on to the next item
        in the list.</P>

    <P>It must be remembered that the variables to be read must be of exactly the same type as
        the data held at the current position. If you match up one type of stored data with a different
        type of variable after a READ command, the appropriate error message will be given. Here is an
        example of correct matching:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">N=Rnd(100)
Read A$,B,C,D$
Print A$,B,C,D$
Data "Text string",100,N,"AMOS"+"Professional"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-restore">RESTORE</h3>
    <p><i>structure: set the current READ pointer</i><BR>
        <b>Restore</b> Label<BR>
        <b>Restore</b> LABEL$<BR>
        <b>Restore</b> Line<BR>
        <b>Restore</b> number</P>

    <P>To change the order in which your data is read from the order in which it was
        originally stored, you can alter the point where a READ operation expects to find the next DATA statement.
        The RESTORE command sets the position of this pointer by referring to a particular label or
        line number, and both labels and numbers may be calculated as part of an expression.</P>

    <P>For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Restore LAST
Read A$
Print A$
Data "First"
Data "Middle"
LAST:
Data "Last"
</code>

    <p>
        Each AMOS Professional procedure has its own individual data pointer, so any calls to
        the command will apply to the current procedure only.</p>

    <p>
        RESTORE is one of the AMOS Professional programmer's most useful devices to force the computer
        to select information, depending on the actions of the user. It can be used for educational and
        business routines as well as adventure and role-playing games.</p>
