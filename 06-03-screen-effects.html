    <h1>Screen Effects</h1>

    <p>The AMOS Professional programmer expects to achieve superb visual effects with simple,
        economic commands. Classic cinematic and video techniques are readily available, as well as
        more spectacular routines that are only made possible by the power of the computer.</p>

    <p>When the image of one screen dissolves and melts into the image of another screen, various
        "fade" effects are produced.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-appear">APPEAR</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: fade between two screens</i><br>
        <b>Appear</b> source screen <b>To</b> destination screen, pixels<br>
        <b>Appear</b> source screen <b>To</b> destination screen, number pixels, range</p>

    <p>
        This command creates a fade between two pictures. Choose the number of the source screen
        where the original picture comes from, then the number of the destination screen whose picture
        it fades into. LOGIC and PHYSIC functions can be substituted for screen numbers, if required.</p>

    <p>
        Next determine a value that will cause the desired effect, by setting the number of pixel points
        on the screen, ranging from 1 pixel all the way up to every pixel in the display.</p>

    <p>
        Normally APPEAR affects the whole of your screen area, but there is an optional parameter that
        causes only part of the screen to be faded. Because screens are drawn from top to bottom, set the
        area to be faded by adding the range of the number of pixels from the top of the screen.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.Abk"
Flash Off : Get Bob Palette
Paste Bob 100,0,1
Wait 100
Screen Open 1,320,90,16,Lowres
Flash Off : Get Bob Palette
Appear 0 To 1,1,28800
</code>

    <p>
        That example fades the top part of your default screen into the newly opened Screen 1.
        Obviously, the appearance of fades will vary, depending on the screen mode being used.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-fade">FADE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: blend colours to new values</i><br>
        <b>Fade</b> speed<br>
        <b>Fade</b> speed,colour list<br>
        <b>Fade</b> speed <b>To</b> screen number<br>
        <b>Fade</b> speed <b>To</b> screen number,mask</p>

    <p>
        The classic "fade to black" movie effect takes the current palette and gradually fades all values to
        zero. Set the speed of the fade by choosing the number of vertical blank periods between each
        colour change. Try this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Flash Off : Curs Off
Centre "GOOD NIGHT"
Fade 5
</code>

    <p>
        Fade effects are executed using interrupts, so it is sensible to wait until the fade has ended
        before going on to the next program instruction. The length of wait required can be calculated
        with this formula:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Fade 5 : Wait 75</code>

    <p>
        By adding a list of colour values, the fade effect will generate a new palette directly from your
        list, and it is used like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Flash Off : Curs Off
Centre "RED SKY AT NIGHT"
Fade 10,$100,$F00,$300
Wait 150
</code>

    <p>
        Any number of new colours can be set up like this, depending on the maximum number
        allowed in your current screen mode. Any settings that are omitted will leave those colours
        completely unaffected by the fade, as long as you include the right number of commas.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Fade 5,,$100,,,$200,$300</code>

    <p>
        There is an even more powerful use of the FADE command, which takes the palette from
        another screen and fades it into the colours of the current screen. Set the speed of the fade as
        usual, then give the number of the screen whose palette is to be accessed. By using a negative
        number instead of a screen number, the palette from the sprite bank will be loaded instead.</p>

    <p>
        There is one more parameter that can be added, and this creates a mask that only permits
        certain colours to be faded in. Each colour is associated with a single bit in the pattern,
        numbered from 0 to 15, and any bit that is set to 1 will be affected by a colour change.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.Abk"
Screen Open 1,320,90,16,Lowres
Flash Off : Get Object Palette
Paste Bob 100,0,1
Wait 100
Fade 1 To 0,%01111000011001010
Wait 15

<section id="01-flashing-colours">
    <h2>Flashing colours</h2>

    <p>You will already be aware that colour index number 3 is pre-set to flash on and off, and is the</p>

    <p>
        default setting for the text cursor. By using interrupts, any colour index can be cycled through a
        series of colour changes, producing complex flashing effects.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-flash">FLASH</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set flashing colour sequence</i><br>
        <b>Flash</b> index number,"(colour,delay)(colour,delay)(colour,delay)..."<br>
        <b>Flash</b> Off</p>

    <p>
        When FLASH is followed by the index number of any colour, that colour will display animated
        flashing every time it is used, until FLASH OFF is called. Up to 16 colours can be cycled to
        customise your flashing effects, and the rate of delay from one colour change to the next can be
        individually set. Try this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Flash 1 ,"(0A0,10)(F0F,40)"</code>

    <p>
        In that example, the colour to be affected is set to index number 1. After the comma, the set of
        quotation marks can contain up to 16 pairs of brackets, and each pair of brackets contains the
        colour that is next on the list to be flashed, and the time it will appear for. Colour is set in RGB
        component values, which are fully explained in the next Chapter. Delay time is set in units of a
        50th of a second. So the last example has the effect of flashing colour number 1 between a green
        value and a violet value once every second. The next example is more subtle:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls : Centre "SILENT MOVIES"
Flash 1,"(111,4)(333,4)(555,4)(777,4)(555,7)(333,7)
Curs Off : Wait 250 : Flash Off
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-shift-up">SHIFT UP</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: rotate colour values upwards</i><br>
        <b>Shift Up</b> delay,first,last,flag</p>

    <p>
        This command takes the values held in the colour registers and shunts them forwards. The
        delay between colour shifts is set in 50ths of a second, similarly to the FADE command.</p>

    <p>
        Next the values of the colours to be affected are set, from the first colour to the last colour in the
        sequence. The first colour in the list will be copied to the second, the second to the third, and so
        on until the last colour in the series is reached.</p>

    <p>
        Finally, a flag is set to either 0 or 1. When this flag is set to zero, the last colour is discarded, and
        the rotation will cycle for the number of times it takes to replace all colours with the first colour
        in the list. Alternatively, if the flag is set to one, the last colour index in the list is copied into the
        first, causing the colours to rotate continuously on screen.</p>

    <p>
        Each of your screens can have its own set of animated colour rotations, and because they are
        executed using interrupts they will not affect the running of your programs.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-shift-down">SHIFT DOWN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: rotate colour values downwards</i><br>
        <b>Shift Down</b> delay,first,last,flag</p>

    <p>
        This command is identical to SHIFT UP, except for the fact that colours are rotated in the
        opposite direction, so that the second colour is copied into the first, the third to the second, and
        so on. With the final flag set to zero, all colours are eventually replaced with the last colour in
        the list.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-shift-off">SHIFT OFF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: turn off all colour shifts for current screen</i><br>
        <b>Shift Off</b></p>

    <p>
        Use this command to terminate all colour rotations previously set by the SHIFT UP and SHIFT
        DOWN instructions.</p>
</section>

<section id="02-rainbow-effects">
    <h2>Rainbow effects</h2>

    <p>So far, most of the screen effects in this Chapter take a colour index and change its value over a
        set period of time. AMOS Professional offers an alternative system, where colour indexes are
        changed depending on specific screen locations. This means that a single colour index can be
        used to generate hundreds of colours in some spectacular rainbow effects. Before any rainbows
        can be conjured up, their parameters must first be set.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-set-rainbow">SET RAINBOW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: define a rainbow</i><br>
        <b>Set Rainbow</b> number,index,height,red$,green$,blue$</p>

    <p>Try the next example before analysing how it works:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Set Rainbow 0,1,16,"(1,1,15)","",""
Rainbow 0,56,1,255
Curs Off : Flash Off
Locate ,12 : Centre "RED STRIPE"
</code>

    <p>
        Up to four different rainbows may be set up for later use, and SET RAINBOW is followed by an
        identification number for this rainbow, from 0 to 3.</p>

    <p>
        The next parameter is the colour index that is to be changed, and only colours 0 to 15 can be
        affected. In practice, this colour can be assigned a different value for each horizontal screen scan
        line, if necessary.</p>

    <p>
        Following this, the height parameter sets the size of the table to be used for colour storage, in
        other words, it sets the height of the rainbow in units, with each unit ready to hold one scan line
        of colour. The size of this table can range from 16 to 65500, but only the first 280 or so lines can
        be displayed on screen at once. So if your table is less than the physical height of your rainbow,
        the colour pattern will be repeated on the screen.</p>

    <p>
        Finally, the Red, Blue and Green components of the rainbow colours are set up as strings, each
        within their own brackets. The last example leaves out any reference to the Green and Blue
        components, which is why the resulting effect is completely in the Red. These strings will be</p>

    <p>
        cycled to produce the final rainbow pattern, and their format comprises three values contained
        in each relevant pair of brackets, as follows:</p>

    <p>(number,step,count)</p>

    <p>
        Number refers to the number of scan lines assigned to one colour value. Think of it as
        controlling the "speed" of the sequence. Step is a value to be added to the colour, which controls
        the colour change. Count is simply the number of times this whole process is performed.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-rainbow">RAINBOW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: display a rainbow</i><br>
        <b>Rainbow</b> number,offset,vertical position,height</p>

    <p>
        The last example also demonstrates the parameters of the RAINBOW command, which is used
        to display one of the rainbows created with SET RAINBOW.</p>

    <p>
        The rainbow number is obvious, and refers to one of the four possible rainbow patterns from 0
        to 3. The offset sets the value for the first colour in the table created with SET RAINBOW, and it
        governs the cycling or repetition of the rainbow on screen.</p>

    <p>
        The vertical position is a coordinate which must have a minimum value of 40, and it affects the
        starting point of the rainbow's vertical display on screen. If a lower coordinate is used, the
        rainbow will be displayed from line number 40 onwards.</p>

    <p>Finally, the height number sets the rainbow's vertical height in screen scan lines.</p>

    <p>
        Please note that normally only one rainbow at a time can be displayed at a particular scan line,
        and the one with the lowest identification number will be drawn in front of any others
        However, experienced Amiga users will be able to start more than one rainbow at the same line,
        using the Copper. See <a href="14-appendix-f-copper-lists.html">Appendix F</a> for an explanation of this technique.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-rainbow-del">RAINBOW DEL</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: delete a rainbow</i><br>
        <b>Rainbow Del</b><br>
        <b>Rainbow Del</b> number</p>

    <p>
        Use this command on its own to get rid of all rainbows that have been set up. If a rainbow
        identity number is added, then only that particular rainbow will be deleted.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="resv-rain">RAIN</h3>
    <p><i>function: change the colour of a rainbow line</i><br>
        <b>Rain</b>(number,line)=colour</p>

    <p>
        This powerful rainbow instruction allows you to change the colour of any rainbow line to
        value you choose. RAIN is followed by a pair of brackets containing the number of the rainbow
        to be changed and the scan line number that is to be affected.</p>

    <p>
        The next example demonstrates the following technique. Rainbow number 1, with colour index
        1, is given a colour table length of 4097, which is one entry for every colour value that will be
        displayed on screen. The RGB values are left blank, to be set up by the first FOR ... NEXT
        routine, that contains the RAIN command. The second FOR ... NEXT routine uses RAINBOW to
        display a pattern 255 lines long, starting at scan line 40. The DO ... LOOP structure is used to
        repeat the process.</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Curs Off : Centre "OVER THE RAINBOW"
Set Rainbow 1,1,4097,"","",""
For L=0 To 4095
 Rain(1,L)=L
Next L
Do
 For 0=0 To 4095-255 Step 4
  Rainbow 1,C,40,255
  Wait Vbl
 Next C
Loop

<section id="03-the-copper-list">
    <h2>The copper list</h2>

    <p>The appearance of every line displayed on your screen is controlled by the Amiga's co-
        processor, known as the "copper". The copper is a self-contained processor with its own special
        set of instructions, and its own internal memory. A massive number of special effects can be
        created by programming the copper, but the copper list is notoriously difficult to manipulate,
        and many competent programmers have failed to master its mysteries.</p>

    <p>A full discussion of the copper lists may be found in <a href="14-appendix-f-copper-lists.html">Appendix F</a> of this User Guide.</p>
