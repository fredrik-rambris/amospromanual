    <h1>The Bare Bones</h1>

    <P>
        Ths Chapter provides you with the bare bones that support AMOS Professional
        programming. These bones are used to build program skeletons, and you need to understand what they do
        and how they work before adding the life-blood, the muscle-power and the brain-control
        that endow a program with its own life.</P>

    <P>
        If you are an experienced programmer, you will already be familiar with these bare
        bones, and you can safely skip through most of this Chapter.</P>

    <P>
        AMOS Professional is designed to provide you with the easiest and most convenient way
        of controlling all your programming needs, and even though it provides very powerful
        programming features, difficult concepts and terms are avoided wherever possible.
        This section begins with one of the simplest concepts in computing, known as
        "strings".</P>
</section>

<section id="01-strings">
    <h2>Strings</h2>

    <p>A "string" is a number of characters strung together. A set of quotation marks is
        placed at either end of the string to hold it together and keep it separate from the rest of the program.
        Each string is also identified by its own name, so that it can be called up by that name, and
        used elsewhere in the program. The "dollar" character $ is attached to the end of every string
        name, to mark the fact that this name refers to a string. On UK Keyboards, quote marks are typed
        in by pressing the <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>2</kbd> keys together, and the $ character is typed with <kbd>Shift</kbd> plus <kbd>4</kbd>.</P>

    <P>
        Characters in a string can be letters, numbers, symbols or spaces. The following
        example creates a simple string named A$, and it is defined by letting the name of the string equal the
        characters enclosed in quotes, like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">"AMOS Professional"
Print A$
</code>

    <P>Here is another example, using three different strings:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">A$="AMOS"
B$=""
C$="Professional"
Print A$+B$+C$
</code>

    <P>Strings are extremely useful, and they can act on their own or work together, as that
        last example demonstrated. Try the next example now:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">A$="AMOS PROFESSIONAL"-"S"
Print A$
</code>

    <P>The whole of <a href="05-02-string-functions.html">Chapter 5.2</a> is devoted to how AMOS Professional makes use of strings.</P>
</section>

<section id="02-variables">
    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>There are certain elements of a computer program that are set aside to store the results
        of calculations. The names of these storage locations are known as "variables".</P>

    <p>
        Think of a variable as the name of a place where a value resides, and that the value can
        change as the result of a calculation made by your computer. Like strings, variables are given
        their own names, and once a name has been chosen it can be given a value, like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">SCORE=100
Print SCORE
</code>

    <P>That example creates a variable with the name of SCORE, and loads it with a value of 100.</P>
</section>

<section id="03-naming-variables">
    <h2>Naming variables</h2>

    <p>The rules for the naming of variables are very simple. Firstly, all variable names must
        begin with a letter, so the following variable name is fine:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">AMOS2=1
Print AMOS2
</code>

    <P>But the next name is not allowed:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">2AMOS=1
</code>

    <P>
        Secondly, you cannot begin a variable name with the letters that make up one of the
        AMOS Professional command words, because this would confuse your Amiga. The following variable
        name is acceptable, because the first letters are not used by one of the AMOS Professional
        commands:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">FOOTPRINT=1
Print FOOTPRINT
</code>

    <P>But the next name is unacceptable, because the computer recognises the first five
        letters as the command PRINT:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">PRINTFOOT=1
</code>

    <P>
        If you try and type in an illegal variable name, AMOS Professional will spot the
        mistake, and point it out by splitting the illegal characters away from the rest of the name. A full
        list of the command words can be found in the Command Index, in Appendix H of this User Guide.</P>

    <P>
        Variable names can be as short as one character, and as long as 255 characters, but
        they can never contain a blank space. So the next name is allowed:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">AMOSPRO=1
Print AMOSPRO
</code>

    <P>But this is an illegal variable name:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">AMOSPRO=1
Print AMOSPRO
</code>

    <P>
        To introduce a name, or split it up, use the "underscore" character instead of spaces, by
        typing <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> together. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">_IAM A_LONG_LEGAL_VARIABLE_NAME=1
Print _IAM A_LONG_LEGAL_VARIABLE_NAME
</code>
</section>

<section id="04-types-of-variables">
    <h2>Types of variables</h2>

    <p>There are three types of variable that can be used in AMOS Professional programs.</P>

    <P><b>Whole Numbers</b><br>

        The first of these types is where the variable represents a whole number, like 1 or
        9999. These variables are perfect for holding the sort of values used in computer games, for example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">HI SCORE=1000000
Print HI SCORE
</code>

    <P>
        Whole numbers are called "integers", and integer variables can range from -147,483,648
        up to 147,483,648.</P>

    <P><b>Real number variables</b><br>

        Variables can also represent fractional values, such as 1.2 or 99.99 and the results
        from this sort of variable can be extremely accurate. The accuracy of numbers either side of a decimal
        point (known as "floating point" numbers) is fully explained in <a href="05-03-maths.html">Chapter 5.3</a>.</P>

    <P>Real number variables must always have a "hash" symbol added to the end of their names,
        which is typed by pressing the tit] key. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">REAL_NUMBER#=3.14
Print REAL_NUMBER#
</code>

    <P><b>String variables</b><br>

        This type of variable holds text characters, and the length of the text can be anything
        from zero up to 65,500 characters long. String variables are enclosed in quotation marks, and are
        also distinguished from number variables by a $ character on the end of their names, to tell
        AMOS Professional that they will contain text rather than numbers. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">NAME$="Name"
GUITAR$="Twang"
Print NAME$,GUITAR$
</code>
</section>

<section id="05-storing-variables">
    <h2>Storing variables</h2>

    <p>All variables are stored in an 8k memory area called a "buffer". This area can hold
        about 2000 numbers or two pages of normal text, and it has been set as small as possible to allow
        more space for memory banks and screens of graphics. When there is not enough room left to
        store all of the variables in a program, an error message will appear saying "Out of variable
        space". The size of the storage space for variables can be increased at any time, and the only limit
        to the size of arrays and string variables is the amount of memory available in your computer.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-set-buffer">SET BUFFER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set the size of the variable area</i><BR>
        <b>Set Buffer</b> number of kilobytes</P>

    <P>
        The SET BUFFER command can be used inside a program to set the new size of the variable
        area. Simply follow the command with the number of kilobytes required, and you are
        recommended to increase this value by 5k at a time, until enough space has been reserved
        in the buffer area. It is important to note that the SET BUFFER command must be the very first
        instruction in your program, apart from any REM messages.</P>
</section>

<section id="06-arrays">
    <h2>Arrays</h2>

    <p>It is often necessary to use a whole set of similar variables for something like a
        table of football results or a catalogue for a record collection. Any set of variables can be grouped
        together in what is known as an "array".</P>

    <P>
        Supposing you have 100 titles in your record collection, and you need to tell AMOS
        Professional the size of the table of variables needed for your array. There is a special command for
        setting up this dimension.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-dim">DIM</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: dimension an array</i><BR>
        <b>Dim</b> variable name(number,number,number...)</P>

    <P>
        The DIM command is used to dimension an array, and the variables in your record
        collection table could be set up with a first line like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Dim ARTIST$(99),TITLE$(99),YEAR(99),PRICE#(99)
</code>

    <P>
        Each dimension in the table is held inside round brackets, and if there is more than
        one element
        in a dimension each number must be separated from the next by a comma.</P>

    <P>Element numbers in arrays always start from zero, so your first and last entries might
        contain these variables:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">ARTIST$(0)="Aaron Copeland"
TITLE$(0)="Appalachian Spring"
YEAR(0)=1944
PRICE#(0)=12.99
ARTIST$(99)="ZZ Top"
TITLE$(99)="Afterburner"
YEAR(99)=1985
PRICE#(99)=9.95
</code>

    <P>To extract elements from your array, you could then add something like this to your
        example program:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print TITLE$(0),PRICE#(0)
Print TITLE$(99),YEAR(99),PRICE#(99)
</code>

    <P>These tables can have as many dimensions as you like, and each dimension can have up to
        65,0(K) elements. Here are some more modest examples:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">Dim LIST(5),NUMBER#(5,5,5),WORD$(5,5)
</code>
</section>

<section id="07-constants">
    <h2>Constants</h2>

    <p>Constants are a special type of number or string that can be assigned to a variable, or
        used in a calculation. They are given this name because their value remains constant, and does not
        change during the course of the program.</P>

    <P>
        AMOS Professional will normally treat all constants that are fractional numbers
        (floating point numbers) as whole numbers (integers), and convert them automatically, before they are used.
        For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">A=3.141
Print A
</code>

    <P>
        Any numbers that are typed into an AMOS Professional program are converted into a
        special format. When programs are listed, these numbers are converted back to their original form,
        and this can lead to minor discrepancies between the number that was originally typed in and
        the number that is displayed in the listing. There is no need to worry about this, because the
        value of the number always remains exactly the same.</P>

</section>

<section id="08-functions">
    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>There is a whole set of bare bones in the AMOS Professional skeleton known as
        "functions". These are command words that have one thing in common: they all work with numbers in
        order to give a result.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-free">FREE</h3>
    <p><i>function: give the amount of free memory in the variable buffer area</i><br>
        memory=<b>Free</b></P>

    <P>For an example of a function in operation, the FREE function checks how many "bytes" of
        memory are currently available to hold your variables, and it can be used to make a report, like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "The number of bytes available is:";Free
</code>

    <P>Now use the FREE function with the SET BUFFER command (which is explained earlier in
        this Chapter) as follows:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Set Buffer 13
Print "The number of bytes now available is:";Free
</code>

    <P>
        AMOS Professional provides over 200 ready-made functions, but it allows you to create as many
        different functions as you like! These "user-defined" functions are set up inside your own
        programs, and they can be used to compute commonly used values very quickly and very
        simply.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-def-fn">DEF FN</h3>
    <p><i>structure: create a user-defined function</i><BR>
        <b>Def Fn</b> name (list of variables)=expression</P>

    <P>
        To create a user-defined function, give it a name and follow the name with a list of variables.
        These variables must be held inside a pair of round brackets, and separated from one another by
        commas, like these examples:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">Def Fn NAME$(A$)=LOWER$(A$)
Def Fn X(A,B,C)=A*B*C
</code>

    <p>
        When a user-defined function is called up my variables that are entered with it will be
        substituted in the appropriate positions, as demonstrated below.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-fn">FN</h3>
    <p><i>structure: call a user-defined function</i><BR>
        <b>Fn</b> name(list of variables)</p>

    <p>The following examples show how DEF FN is first used to define a function, and how FN
        calls it up:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Def Fn NAME$(A$,X,Y)=Mid$(A$,X,Y)
Print Fn NAME$("Professional",4,3)
</code>
<br>
<code class="prefix edit">Def Fn X(A,B,C)=A+B+C
Print Fn X(1,10,100)
</code>

    <P>
        The expression that equals the user-defined function can include any of the standard
        AMOS Professional functions, and it is limited to a single line of a program.</p>
</section>

<section id="09-parameters">
    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p>The values that are entered into an AMOS Professional instruction are known as
        "parameters". If there is more than one parameter, each parameter must be separated from its neighbour
        by a comma.</P>

    <P>
        For example, up to three parameters can be used after an INK command, in the form of
        various numbers which specify which colour is to be used for drawing operations, then the
        background colour, and the third parameter setting a border colour. So an INK command could appear
        like this, with its three parameters ready to draw a shape:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Ink 0,1,2
Bar 10,10 To 100,50
</code>

    <!-- section -->

    <p>
        Any parameter can be left out, as long as its comma remains in place. When this happens,
        AMOS professional will check to see what the current value is, or if there is a default
        value for this parameter, and automatically assign this value to the parameter that has been
        omitted. For example:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Ink 0,1,2 : <comment>Rem Set drawing, background and border colour</comment>
Ink 3,, : <comment>Rem Set drawing colour only</comment>
Ink ,4, : <comment>Rem Set background, leave drawing and border colours alone</comment>
</code>
</section>

<section id="10-procedures">
    <h2>Procedures</h2>

    <p>The more complex the skeleton of a program gets, the easier it is to get lost among all
        of its routes and connections. Experienced programmers usually split their programs into small
        units known as "procedures", which allow one aspect of the program to be tackled at a time,
        without getting distracted by everything else that is going on.</P>

    <P>
        AMOS Professional offers all the advantages of using procedures in the most convenient
        way, and <a href="05-05-procedures.html">Chapter 5.5</a> is dedicated to a full explanation of how to exploit them. You will learn
        how each procedure module can be given its own specially defined variables and parameters, and
        how to take best advantage of them.</P>
</section>

<section id="11-controlling-a-program-skeleton">
    <h2>Controlling a program skeleton</h2>
    <P>Once a program is running, there are a number of ways to stop it in its tracks,
        allowing you to control what happens next.</P>

    <P><b>WAIT</b><BR>
        <i>instruction: wait before performing the next instruction</i><BR>
        <b>Wait</b> number of 50ths of a second</P>

    <P>
        The WAIT command tells the computer to stop the program and wait for as long as you
        want before moving on to the next instruction. The number that follows it is the waiting time,
        specified in 50ths of a second.</P>

    <P>The following example forces the program to wait for two seconds:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "I am the first instruction."
Wait 100
Print "I am the next instruction."
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-end">END</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: end the current program</i><BR>
        <b>End</b></P>

    <P>
        As soon as the END command is recognised, it stops the program. You can either press
        the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to go to Direct Mode, or use the [Spacebar] to get to the Edit Screen. Try this
        example now:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "I am the first instruction."
Wait 150
End
Print "This instruction will never be executed!"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-stop">STOP</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: interrupt the current program</i><BR>
        <b>Stop</b></P>

    <P>To stop the current program. The <b>STOP</b> instruction is used like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "Interrupt in two seconds!"
Wait 100
Stop
Print "I have been abandoned"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-edit">EDIT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: leave current program and return to Edit Screen</i><BR>
        <b>Edit</b></P>

    <P>Similarly, the EDIT instruction forces the program to be abandoned, and returns you
        straight to the Edit Screen, like this:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "Wait four seconds and then EDIT"
Wait 200
Edit
Print "I have been ignored!"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-direct">DIRECT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: leave current program and return to Direct Mode</i><BR>
        <b>Direct</b></P>

    <P>Use the DIRECT command to jump out of the current program and go straight to Direct
        Mode for testing out a programming idea.</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print "Take me to Direct Mode immediately"
Direct
</code>

    <P>Normally, a program can be interrupted by pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and the <kbd>C</kbd> keys together,
        returning you to the AMOS Professional Edit Screen. This facility can be turned off and on
        at will, creating a crude sort of program protection.</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-break-off">BREAK OFF</h3>
    <h3 class="command" id="i-break-on">BREAK ON</h3>
    <i>instructions: toggle the program break keys off and on</i><BR>
    <b>Break Off</b><BR>
    <b>Break On</b>

    <P>The BREAK OFF command can be included in a program to stop a particular routine from being
        interrupted while it is running. To re-start the interrupt feature, use BREAK ON. But be <b>warned!</b></P>

    <p>
        Never run a program that is still being edited with BREAK OFF activated, or <b>you will lose
        your work</b>. Make a back-up copy first. Here are two examples, and if you insist on ignoring this
        advice, you may be foolhardy enough to try the second one!</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Break Off
Print "Try and press the Break keys now"
Wait 500
Break On
Print "Break keys activated"
Wait 100
Direct

 Print "Get out of that!"
 Wait Key
Loop
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-system">SYSTEM</h3>
    <i>instruction: go to Workbench</i><BR>
    <b>System</b>

    <P>
        To close AMOS Professional altogether, and go to the Workbench, the <b>System</b> command can
        be given from within a program, or from the Editor. The Direct Mode pre-set icon, is
        explained in <a href="04-01-the-editor.html">Chapter 4.1</a>, or simply press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd>.</P>

</code>
</section>

<section id="12-separating-commands-in-a-line">
    <h2>Separating commands in a line</h2>

    <P>So far in this Chapter, individual instructions have been separated from one another by
        typing them in and pressing the <kbd>Return</kbd> key to enter them on a new line of the program. In fact,
        the AMOS Professional programmer will often want to place groups of related commands together
        on the same line of the program. This is achieved by separating your instructions with a
        colon character.</p>

    <p>
        AMOS Professional makes typing in instructions as simple as possible, and you will not
        normally have to worry about typing in correct spacings, as long as you stick to the
        rules. When a colon is used to split up commands, command words are recognised and given a capital
        letter and a space automatically.</P>

    <P>This can be proved by typing in the next example exactly as it appears below, and
        hitting the <kbd>Return</kbd> key:</P>

<code class="prefix edit">Print"I'm so":wait key:print"neat!"

<section id="13-marking-the-bones-of-a-program">
    <h2>Marking the bones of a program</h2>

    <p>Imagine that the skeleton of your latest programming masterpiece is so clever and so
        complex that you cannot remember where everything is or what anything is supposed to do! There is
        a simple and effective way of marking any part of an AMOS Professional program, by inserting
        typed messages to remind yourself exactly what this section of program is for. These
        little comments or messages are known as "Rem statements".</P>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-rem">REM</h3>
    <p><i>structure: insert a reminder message into a program</i><BR>
        <b>Rem</b> Typed in statement<BR>
        <b>'</b> Typed in statement</P>

    <P>
        The beginning of a Rem statement is marked by REM or by the apostrophe character, which
        is simply a short-cut recognised by AMOS Professional as a REM. The message or comment is
        then typed in from the keyboard, beginning with a capital letter. Here are some examples:</P>

<code class="prefix ex"><comment>'An apostrophe can be used instead of the characters Rem</comment>
<comment>Rem The next line will print a greeting</comment>
Print "a greeting"
<comment>'This line is a comment that does nothing at all</comment>
Wait 75: <comment>Rem Wait one and a half seconds</comment>
<comment>'Return to the Edit Screen</comment>
Edit
</code>

    <P>These reminders are for human intelligence only, and when a Rem statement is
        encountered in a program, it is completely ignored by the computer.</P>

    <P>
        Rem statements can occupy their own line, or be placed at the end of a line of the
        program, as long as they are separated from the last instruction by a colon. But the apostrophe
        character can only be used to mark a Rem statement at the <b>beginning</b> of a line. The first of the next two
        lines is fine, but the second will create an error:</P>

<code class="prefix ex">Print "This example is fine" : <comment>Rem Fine example</comment>
Print "Wrong!" : <comment>' This is illegal</comment>
