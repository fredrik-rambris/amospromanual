    <h1>The Parallel Port</h1>

    <br>


    <p>
        This Chapter provides the bridge between the Amiga's Parallel Port and AMOS Professional.
        One parallel channel may be opened at a time, so if a printer is already attached to the Parallel
        Port, the Parallel device may not be opened at the same time as the Printer device.</p>

    <p>In fact, accessing the Parallel device has three main advantages over the Printer device:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It only uses 5k of memory space, compared to the 50k that can be required for the printer
            driver.
        </li>
        <li>It needs comparatively few system resources.</li>
        <li>It can also be used for input as well as output.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are few disadvantages, although control over sequence conversion is not possible, and
        screen dumps cannot be made via the Parallel Port.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-parallel-open">PARALLEL OPEN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: open the Parallel Port for reading or writing</i><br>
        <b>Parallel Open</b></p>

    <p>
        This instruction initialises the Parallel Port for use by an AMOS Professional program. The first
        time that this command is used in any programming session, the "Parallel.device" driver will be
        loaded into memory. If it is not available, you will be prompted to insert the relevant disc
        automatically.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-parallel-close">PARALLEL CLOSE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: close the parallel port</i><br>
        <b>Parallel Close</b></p>

    <p>This command simply closes the Parallel port.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-parallel-send">PARALLEL SEND</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: send a string of characters to the Parallel Port</i><br>
        <b>Parallel Send</b> text$</p>

    <p>
        This is very similar to the PRINTER SEND command, which is explained in <a href="10-03-accessing-a-printer.html">Chapter 10.3</a>, except
        that text data is transmitted exactly as it appears in the original source string. There is no
        translation of code, so that any Escape codes will be interpreted directly by a printer. Please
        check your printer documentation for details of allowable control codes.</p>

    <p>
        If data is output to a printer via the Parallel Port, each line should be terminated by a single line-
        feed, which is Chr$(10). This tells the printer to print a new line onto paper, starting at the
        current position. If the line-feed is omitted, nothing will appear to happen!
        Characters are transmitted using multi-tasking, so your main program will not wait for printing
        to be completed, but will continue immediately from the next instruction.</p>

    <!-- section -->

    <h3 class="command" id="i-parallel-out">PARALLEL OUT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: send data from memory to the Parallel Port</i><br>
        <b>Parallel Out</b> address,length</p>

    <p>
        This instruction is similar to the PRINTER OUT command, and transmits the specified number
        of characters defined by the length parameter, starting from a given address.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-parallel-input-dollar">PARALLEL INPUT$</h3>
    <p><i>function: read a string from the Parallel Port</i><br>
        text$=<b>Parallel Input$</b>(length[,stop])</p>

    <p>
        The PARALLEL INPUTS function waits for a specific number of characters from the Parallel
        Port. Because this port does not have an internal buffer area, the AMOS Professional program
        will halt completely until all characters have been successfully received. If the requested bytes
        have not arrived after a reasonable amount of time, a time-out error will be generated. This may
        be detected using the TRAP instruction, explained in <a href="12-02-error-handling.html">Chapter 12.2</a>.</p>

    <p>
        The PARALLEL INPUTS parameters are as follows: length holds the number of characters to be
        received. The square brackets can hold an optional stop character, which will end the
        transmission as soon as it is encountered anywhere in an input string.</p>

    <p>
        If you intend to devise a communications protocol using the Parallel Port, then the first item to
        send should be the total number of bytes to be transmitted!</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-parallel-abort">PARALLEL ABORT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: stop a parallel operation</i><br>
        <b>Parallel Abort</b></p>

    <p>
        This command is used to stop a PARALLEL SEND or PARALLEL OUT instruction from
        transmitting any additional information via the Parallel Port. Any characters that are currently in
        transit will be completely lost.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-parallel-check">PARALLEL CHECK</h3>
    <p><i>function: report the availability of the Parallel Port</i><br>
        value=<b>Parallel Check</b></p>

    <p>
        The PARALLEL CHECK function is used to return the readiness of the Parallel Port. The status
        is returned by either a value of zero (False) if it is not available, or -1 (True) if the port is ready for
        use.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-parallel-error">PARALLEL ERROR</h3>
    <p><i>function: check for an error in transmission via the Parallel Port</i><br>
        value=<b>Parallel Error</b></p>

    To check for errors during the current transmission via the Parallel Port, use this function.

    <!-- section -->

    <p>
        A value of zero is returned all the time that everything is proceeding normally, but any other
        value indicates a problem in the current transmission operation.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-parallel-status">PARALLEL STATUS</h3>
    <p><i>function: return the current status of the Parallel Port</i><br>
        status=<b>Parallel Status</b></p>

    <p>
        This function is used to give information concerning the current status of the Parallel Port. Each
        possibility is represented by a single bit in the status report. Here is a table of the relevant bits:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr><th>Bit</th><th>Status</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>Printer selected</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>Paper out</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>Printer busy</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>Direction of transmission (0=read, 1=write)</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>



    <h3 class="command" id="fn-parallel-base">PARALLEL BASE</h3>
    <p><i>function: get the base address of the Parallel Port</i><br>
        address=<b>Parallel Base</b></p>

    <p>
        This function returns the address of the internal memory area that is used to handle the Parallel
        Port. Experienced programmers will be able to read and change various settings, but careless use
        of the PARALLEL BASE function can easily result in problems.</p>
