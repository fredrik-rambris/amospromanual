    <h1>Interface Resources</h1>


    <p>
        Up to now, it has been explained how Interface graphics are generated using built-in Interface
        commands. It is also possible to create superb effects using pre-defined images stored in
        memory.</p>

    <p>
        Each Interface program has access to a set of special resources held in an appropriate memory
        bank. These resources can be created with the Resource Bank Maker, which has <a href="13-07-resource-creator.html">Chapter 13.7</a>
        devoted to it. Once defined, resources can be installed for use with the AMOS Professional
        Interface.</p>

    <p>
        The Resource Bank is normally allocated to memory bank 16, and the loading of a resources file
        is explained at the very end of this Chapter.</p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, this process can be avoided if the current Editor settings are used. As a default,
        AMOS Professional provides instant access to all of the system messages and Editor objects.
        These provide everything needed to generate a wide variety of attractive dialogue boxes.</p>

    <p>
        There are two types of resources: messages, which hold a series of button definitions and titles,
        and packed pictures, which can be anything at all.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="intf-me">ME<span>ssage</span></h3>
    <p><i>Interface function: return a message from the Resource Bank</i><br>
        message=number <b>ME</b></p>

    <p>
        The MEssage function takes a number from the stack and returns the appropriate message from
        the Resource Bank. If the value for the number of the message is out of range, an error will be
        generated. MEssage can be used in a PRint or PrintOutline command, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">A$="PRint 0,0,7,MEssage,5;"
A$=A$+"EXit;"
D=Dialog Box(A$)
</code>

    <p>
        A message can also be displayed directly from the main AMOS Professional program, using the
        RESOURCES function, which is explained later.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="inti-un">UN<span>pack</span></h3>
    <p><i>Interface instruction: unpack an image from Resource Bank</i><br>
        <b>UN</b> x,y,image number;</p>

    <p>
        Packed pictures can be taken from the Resource Bank, and unpacked for items such as buttons
        or dialogue boxes. First specify the x,y-coordinates at which the image is to be unpacked. In this
        case, the x-coordinate is rounded to a multiple of eight. Then specify the number of the single
        image to be unpacked.</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Resource Screen Open 0,640,200,2
A$="UNpack 10,10,13; EXit;"
D=Dialog Box(A$)
</code>


    <p>
        In addition to single images, more complex arrangements can be built up from combining a
        group of individual component images, and the following commands are available to exploit
        this facility.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="inti-li">LI<span>ne</span></h3>
    <p><i>Interface instruction: draw a line from Resource Bank image components</i><br>
        <b>LI</b> x,y,first image,width;</p>

    <p>
        The LIne command is used to construct a line from three single images held in the Resource
        Bank. The x,y-coordinates set the position of the top left-hand corner of the line, with the x-
        coordinate rounded to the nearest multiple of eight pixels. Then the number of the first image to
        be used for the line is given. Lastly, the width of the line is set in pixels, and this width should be
        an exact multiple of the image width, otherwise the width of the line will be increased to the
        nearest image boundary.</p>

    <p>
        The following diagram illustrates the three component images, defining the start, the middle
        and the end of the line.</p>

    <pre>
[1 2 3]
</pre>

    <p>These components can be rearranged to generate larger lines, as illustrated next:</p>

    <pre>
[1|2|2|2|2|3]
</pre>



    <h3 class="command" id="inti-vl">V<span>ertical</span>L<span>ine</span></h3>
    <p><i>Interface instruction: draw a vertical line from Resource Bank components</i><br>
        <b>VL</b> x,y,first image,height</p>

    <p>
        This is very similar to the LIne command, except that it displays a vertical line composed of a
        series of three images held in the Resource Bank. The x,y-coordinates for the top left-hand
        corner of the line are given, followed by the number of the first of the three images to be used in
        the display. Finally, the height of the line is specified, and it will be rounded up to the nearest
        multiple of three automatically.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="inti-bo">BO<span>x</span></h3>
    <p><i>Interface instruction: draw a box from Resource Bank image components</i><br>
        <b>BO</b> x,y,first image,width,height;</p>

    <p>
        Similarly, the BOx instruction draws a rectangular bar from an assortment of nine packed
        images from the Resource Bank. The parameters are the same as for a LIne command, with the
        additional parameter of the height of the box, which can be anything you wish. The component
        images for the rectangle are in the following format:</p>

    <pre>
[1|2|3]
[4|5|6]
[7|8|9]
</pre>


    <p>
        These components can be re-used to produce a large number of possible displays, such as in the
        next example diagram:</p>

    <pre>
[1|2|2|2|3]
[4|5|5|5|6]
[4|5|5|5|6]
[7|8|8|8|9]
</pre>



    <h3 class="command" id="inti-pu">PU<span>sh</span></h3>
    <p><i>Interface instruction: push image to an offset position in the Resource Bank</i><br>
        <b>PU</b> offset;</p>

    <p>
        The PUsh command sets an offset value to the first image in the Resource Bank, and this offset
        will be added to all subsequent image numbers. This means that you can make a dialogue box
        totally independent from the images in the Resource Bank. For example, if new images are
        added at the beginning of the bank at any subsequent time, the images used by your existing
        resource commands will be pushed down the required number of places, and they will work
        perfectly without any changes in numbering required. To demonstrate this, the following two
        lines would have exactly the same effect:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">PUsh 0; UNpack 0,0,13;
PUsh 13; UNpack 0,0,0;

<section id="01-the-resource-commands">
    <h2>The Resource commands</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a full explanation of the additional AMOS Professional instructions and functions that
        can be used to exploit the Resource Bank.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-resource-bank">RESOURCE BANK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: select a bank to be used for resources</i><br>
        <b>Resource Bank</b> number</p>

    <p>
        This command is used to tell AMOS Professional in which bank the resources to be used by
        Interface programs are kept. The number parameter holds the number of the memory bank to
        be allocated. If this bank does not exist, the Editor's internal resource bank will be used as a
        default. This means that after this command has been called, you can return to the Editor
        resources by employing a dummy value, such as zero. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Load "Resource.Abk",16 : <comment>Rem This can be any filename</comment>
Resource Bank 16: <comment>Rem Set resources to Bank 16</comment>
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-resource-dollar">RESOURCE$</h3>
    <p><i>function: read a message from the Resource Bank</i><br>
        message=<b>Resource$</b>(message number)</p>

    <p>
        The RESOURCE$ function returns one of the messages from the current Resource Bank, to be
        used by an AMOS Professional program. If the bank has not been defined, the standard Editor
        messages will be made available from the Configuration file.</p>


    <p>
        Each national grouping is provided with its own set of messages in the appropriate language,
        and these messages can be used to generate multi-language programs.
        The message number parameter enters the number of the message. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">For A=1 To 7
 Print Resource$(A)
Next A
</code>

    <p>The following list shows the strings related to the various numbers:</p>

    <pre>
<b>Number           Message</b>
>0               String from the Resource bank
0                Full pathname of APSystem folder
<0               Configuration system strings, as follows:
-1 to -9         Default file names
-10 to -36       All 26 extensions
38, -38          Communication ports
-40              Default cursor flashing
2001 to -2044    Miscellaneous strings used by Editor
-2045 to -2049   Editor system files
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-resource-screen-open">RESOURCE SCREEN OPEN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: open a screen using the resource settings</i><br>
        <b>Resource Screen Open</b> number,width,height,flash</p>

    <p>
        This instruction opens a screen using the settings that are stored in the Resource Bank. These
        screen settings include the number of colours, the resolution and the entire colour palette.</p>

    <p>
        The parameters are given in the following order: the number of the screen to be defined from
        zero to 7, the width of this screen in pixels and the height of the screen in lines. Finally a simple
        flag is set for the flash feature, with a value of zero to turn off the flash, or any other appropriate
        value to assign the flash effect to that colour index number.</p>

    <p>The new screen will be installed with the colour palette held in the Resource Bank.</p>

    <p>
        The following example opens a screen using the settings from the internal Resource Bank, just
        like the Editor screen, where the flashing colour is index number 2.</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Resource Screen Open 0,640,200,2</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-resource-unpack">RESOURCE UNPACK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: unpack an image from the Resource Bank</i><br>
        <b>Resource Unpack</b> number,x,y</p>

    <p>
        This AMOS Professional command unpacks a single element from the current Resource Bank
        and displays it on the screen.</p>


    <p>
        The number parameter refers to the number of the element to be displayed, and the x,y-
        coordinates specify the position of the new image on screen.</p>

    <p>
        The instruction can be used directly in games programs to hold the various graphics
        components in a very compact format. These images can be saved in the Resource Bank using
        the Resource Bank Maker, and installed into memory along the following lines:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Load "Resource.Abk",l6 : <comment>Rem This can be any filename</comment>
Resource Bank 16 : <comment>Rem set the resources to bank 16</comment>
</code>

<section id="02-the-default-resource">
    <h2>The Default Resource</h2>
    <p>
        If you do not load your own resource bank, the default will be used. It is the same as much
        of the default AMOS Professional user interface is using. Here is a list of the resources available:
