    <h2>AMOS Professional Installation Procedure</h2>

    <p>To prepare AMOS Professional ready for your exploitation and
        enjoyment, the System Disc must be installed for all users, and other
        features made accessible for hard disc users. This is very simple and
        all instructions are displayed on screen, step by step. Here is an
        outline of the installation procedure from a floppy disc:</p>

    <p><b>Step One</b><br>

        Take the disc labelled AMOSPro_System:, and make sure that it
        is write-enabled. In other words, ensure that the tab at the top
        right-hand corner of the disc is in the closed position, so that it
        covers the small square hole. This will allow you to personalise your
        copy of AMOS Professional, with your own name appearing on screen to
        greet you.</p>

    <p>If your Amiga is switched on, make sure that the drive light
        is <b>not</b> illuminated, and take out any disc that may
        be in the drive.
        Switch <b>off</b> your computer and wait about twenty
        seconds to let it clear
        its memory and forget any bad habits that may be lurking there.</p>

    <p>Place the write-enabled AMOS Professional System Disc into the
        internal floppy drive, and switch on.</p>

    <p><b>Step Two</b><br>

        Sit back and enjoy the AMOS Professional animated musical
        introduction! After a short pause, this screen fades and the next
        screen appears.</p>

    <!-- section -->

    <p><b>Step Three</b><br>

        This is the Registration Screen, asking you to type in your first name
        and last name, then click on the [OK] panel with the mouse.
    <p>

    <p>In this User Guide, whenever an option is referred to that
        appears on the screen, waiting to be
        selected, it is enclosed in square brackets on the printed page.</p>

    <p>If you make a mistake when typing, you may insert your first
        or last name again, and when both
        names are entered correctly, trigger the [OK] button.</p>


    <p>If for some reason this operation is unsuccessful, a screen
        will appear advising you what to do.
        Please make sure that you are using your <b>original</b> AMOS Professional
        System Disc, and that it is
        write-enabled before proceeding. If all else fails, and your disc drive
        is opera ling correctly, and if the disc in the drive is the original
        write-enabled System disc, then there must be a fault on the disc.
        Please return it for a free re-duplication to:</p>


    <p><b>AMOS Professional Customer Support</b><br>

        Europress Software Ltd.<br>
        Europa House<br>
        Adlington Park<br>
        Macclesfield<br>
        SK10 4NP<br>
        England<br>

        Telephone: 0625 859 333 (UK), or +(44) 625 859 333 (International)
        Fax: 0625 879 962 (UK), or +(44) 625 879 962 (international)</p>


    <p>Fortunately, you are very unlikely to encounter a faulty disc,
        and there should be no problems
        in having your name accepted before proceeding to the next step.</p>


    <p><b>Step Four</b><br>

        The AMOS Professional registration screen appears, containing
        your unique Registration Number. Write down this number <b>now</b>, and also
        copy your Registration Number onto the following items:</p>


    <ul>

        <li>All of your original AMOS Professional disc labels.</li>

        <li>The Registration Panel on the inside front cover of this User Guide.</li>

        <li>Your AMOS Professional Registration Card. Please return this card to
            Europress Software
            (Freepost), and take full benefit of the AMOS Professional Customer
            Support service, but
            make sure that you have used AMOS Professional for at least <b>two weeks</b>
            before doing so.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Remember to quote your unique Registration Number when
        contacting Europress Software with any enquiries.</p>

    <p>Click on the [OK] panel to reveal the next screen.</p>

    <!-- section -->

    <p><b>Step Five</b><br>

        This is the Installation Screen, and your System Disc will now
        boot directly into AMOS
        Professional. If you want to boot from floppy disc, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Left Amiga</kbd>+<kbd>Right Amiga</kbd>
        now. Hard disc users should continue as explained below.</p>

    <p>In this User Guide, whenever you are asked to press a
        particular key, the key is enclosed in
        square brackets on the printed page. When two or more keys should be
        pressed at the same
        time, a plus sign is used to link the individual keys together. So to
        boot AMOS Professional from
        floppy disc now, you are asked to press the control key at the same
        time as both of the special
        Amiga keys that are either side of the space bar on your keyboard, or
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Left Amiga</kbd>+<kbd>Right Amiga</kbd>.</p>

    <p>Now is the time to fill in your Registration Numbers and <b>back
        up your original AMOS Professional discs</b>. Making copies of discs is very simple,
        using the AMOS Professional Disc
        Manager utility, which is fully explained in Chapter 13.4.</p>
</section>

<section id="02-hard-disc-users">
    <h2>Hard Disc Users</h2>

    <p>With the Installation Screen still displayed, hard disc users
        should click on the [OK] panel. The
        start-up sequence is changed from running the Installer to running AMOS
        Professional, but the
        Installer can be recalled by double-clicking on its Workbench icon.</p>

    <p><b>Step Six</b><br>

        Hard Disc Users are taken to the AMOS Professional Hard Disc
        Installation Screen. When this
        appears, simply indicate which items you would like installed onto your
        hard disc, and as each
        item is selected, the appropriate number of kilobytes required will be
        shown. You have the
        option to [Quit] at this stage, in which case you will be returned to
        the Workbench or CLI,
        depending on how the Installer was booted. Otherwise, when the required
        items have been
        selected, click on [Install].</p>

    <p><b>Step Seven</b><br>

        If [Install] is chosen, a file selector appears, and you are
        requested to select the device and
        current path for the installation of AMOS Professional. After making
        your selection, click on
        [OK] to proceed to Step Eight of the Installation procedure.
        Alternatively, the [Cancel] option
        will return you to Step Six again.</p>

    <p><b>Step Eight</b><br>

        Everything is now automatic. If there is not enough memory
        available on the selected device,
        this fact will be reported. You will be returned to Step Six to make a
        more modest selection.
        Otherwise, a loading and saving sequence is displayed, consisting of an
        Installation report for
        each named file, in the form of a percentage figure and an animated bar.</p>

    <p><b>Step Nine</b><br>

        Once all files have been successfully installed on hard disc, a final
        report is displayed, along with an option to [Quit].</p>

    <p>The installation procedure will analyse what type of system it
        is being installed onto
        and will configure your AMOS Professional software appropriately.<br>
        See <a href="13-01-configuration.html">Chapter 13.1</a> regarding these settings.</p>
