<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<br>

<P>AMOS Professional is a truly comprehensive programming package, allowing experts to 
release their full potential. It has also been designed to provide beginners with rapid access to 
expert techniques. However, this section is for absolute beginners only!</P>

<P>If you have upgraded from Easy AMOS or its big brother AMOS, don't be too proud to skip
through this Chapter before moving on to Chapter 4.1, where the AMOS Professional Editor 
is explained.</P>

<P><b>Warning:</b> if you have not yet installed your AMOS Professional System disc, please do 
	so now by referring to <a href="../2/201.html">Chapter 2.1.</a></P>

<P><b>Absolute Beginners</b><br>

A computer program is simply a collection of instructions telling a computer to perform 
a list of tasks. Amiga programs are stored on magnetic discs, and because disc programs are stored
magnetically, you must keep them clear of all magnetic objects. Placing a telephone on top 
of a hard disc drive can be a risk, and leaving floppy discs on top of your television set or
loudspeaker system is asking for trouble. Always make back-up discs of your programs, and
store them in a safe place out of direct sunlight.</P>

<P>Computer programs that are stored on magnetic discs have to be "loaded" into your 
computer's memory. If you are using floppy discs, here is the procedure for loading AMOS 
Professional:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>To explore all of the system's features, a colour television or monitor should be 
  connected to
  your Amiga via the appropriate cable. Additionally, a stereo audio system should be
  connected to the computer's left and right audio sockets. Make sure that your mouse is 
  also connected to the appropriate socket.</LI>

  <LI>Remove any disc that may be in your Amiga's internal floppy disc drive, switch off 
  the machine, and wait at least ten seconds.</LI>

  <LI>Place your AMOSPro_System disc in the Amiga's internal floppy disc drive and switch 
  on the computer.</LI>

  <LI>AMOS Professional will load into the machine's memory automatically.</LI>

  <LI>Remember to make back-up copies of your original AMOS Professional discs, and keep 
  the originals in a safe place.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Hard disc users who want to load AMOS Professional from the Workbench once it has been
installed should double-click on the AMOS Professional System disc icon, and then click on 
the relevant icon to run the program. If you are running the system from CLI, simply type in:<br>
AMOSPro</P>
