<P>
currently being worked on in the Editor. Type the following line in Direct Mode now, and 
then press the [Return] key.</P>

<pre>D&gt;Print "This is Direct Mode"</pre>

<P>Direct Mode offers a simple way of gaining access to a disc, to examine its contents, 
or load some images. It also allows you to check the results of instant tests of text, 
graphics and sound commands, before including them in your programs. Try out the following lines from Direct
Mode now, and remember to press [Return] after typing in each line. The first line 
instructs AMOS Professional to report how many little dots known as "pixels" make up the height of 
the current screen. The middle line calls for a report of how much free chip memory is 
available. The third line triggers a print-out of the contents of the current disc, known as a 
"directory".</P>

<P>There is a full guided tour around all of the Direct Mode operations in the next Chapter.</P>

<P>To end this beginner's introduction, take a look at some ready-made programs that have been
created by other programmers using AMOS Professional. If you have been experimenting, and
are not quite sure of everything that is displayed on screen at the moment, leave your
AMOSPro_System disc in place, and press [Ctrl] + [Amiga] + [Amiga] to make sure that you 
start from scratch again.</P>

<P>After being greeted by your name, and revealing the Edit Screen, remove your
AMOSPro_System disc and insert the disc labelled AMOSPro_Productivityl.</P>

<P><b>Loading a program</b><br>

As usual with AMOS Professional, you have a choice of how to select the loading operation.
You can call up the Main Menu titles with the right mouse button, and select the [Load] 
option from the [Project] menu in the usual way. Alternatively, there is a keyboard short-cut by
pressing [Amiga] + [L]. Either operation will call up a special interactive panel called a 
"File Selector". A file is simply a self-contained chunk of computer data, with its own name, 
held on a magnetic disc.</P>

<P>With the File Selector in the middle of your screen, use the mouse pointer to highlight 
one of the programs on offer, and click on the [Return] icon. If you are interested in an 
arcade game, you can select and highlight the line that reads Zybex/Zybex.AMOS, or if you 
prefer a practical program then Fileo'fax.AMOS is worth examining.</P>

<P>Certain programs need more memory than others, and if there is not enough memory 
available when you want to load a particular program, you will be presented with a "dialogue box" on 
the screen, asking if you want to expand the size of the relevant memory. When dialogue boxes 
are presented by AMOS Professional, you normally select your response using the mouse pointer 
and clicking on the left mouse button.</P>
