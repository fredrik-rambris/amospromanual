    <h1>Error Handling</h1>


    <p>
        When AMOS Professional encounters an error in your programs, or if you attempt the
        impossible, automatic assistance is offered in the form of error messages displayed in the
        information line. If this happens while you are programming, you can try to correct the mistake
        immediately. If the problem is found when you try to test or run a program, AMOS Professional
        will take you to the offending line as soon as you edit.</p>

    <h2>Trapping errors</h2>
    <p>
        Routines can be set up in advance for handling errors inside an AMOS Professional program, so
        that when a mistake is spotted, error trapping swings into action. This process is triggered by the
        following command:</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-on-error">ON ERROR</h3>
    <p><i>structure: trap an error within a Basic program</i><br>
        <b>On Error</b> Goto label</p>

    <p>
        By this method, when an error occurs in your Basic program, a jump is made to whatever label
        has been defined. This label acts as the starting point for your own error correction routine, and
        after the mistake has been corrected you can return to your main program without the need to
        go via the editor window. Try this simple routine:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Do
 Input "Type in two numbers";A,B
 Print A;" divided by ";B;" is ";A/B
Loop
</code>

    <p>
        This will work perfectly until you try to enter a value of zero for B and it is discovered that
        division by zero is impossible. Such unforeseen problems can be catered for by setting an error
        trap like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">On Error Goto HELP
AGAIN:
 Do
  Input "Type in two numbers";A,B
  Print A;" divided by ";B;" is ";A/B
 Loop
 Rem Error Handler
 HELP:
 Print
 Print "Sorry, you have tried to divide"
 Print "your number by zero."
 Resume AGAIN : <comment>Rem Go back to input</comment>
</code>

    <p>
        If you are unfortunate enough to write an error inside your own error trapping routine, AMOS
        Professional will grind to a halt! There are two ways to deliberately disable ON ERROR GOTO.</p>

<code class="prefix ex">On Error : <comment>Rem disable error trap</comment></code>


    <p>Call ON ERROR without any parameters like that, or force it to go to zero, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">On Error Goto 0</code>

    <p>
        To get back to your program after ON ERROR has been called, you must use RESUME. Never
        use GOTO for this purpose.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-resume">RESUME</h3>
    <p><i>structure: resume the execution of current program after an error trapping routine</i><br>
        <b>Resume</b><br>
        <b>Resume Next</b><br>
        <b>Resume</b> labelname<br>
        <b>Resume</b> linenumber</p>

    <p>
        Used on its own, RESUME will jump back to the statement which caused the error and try it
        again. To return to the instruction immediately after the one that caused the error, use RESUME
        NEXT. Alternatively, to jump to a specific point in your main program, simply follow RESUME
        with a reference to a chosen label or a normal line number.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="str-on-error-proc">ON ERROR PROC</h3>
    <p><i>structure: trap an error using a procedure</i><br>
        <b>On Error Proc</b> name</p>

    <p>
        Errors can also be trapped using a procedure. ON ERROR PROC selects a named procedure
        which is automatically called if there is an error in the main program. In fact, this is a structured
        version of the ON ERROR GOTO command. In this case, your procedure must be terminated by
        an END PROC in the usual way, then return to the main program with an additional call to
        RESUME, which can be placed just before the final END PROC statement. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">On Error Proc HELP
 Do
  Input "Type in two numbers";A,B
  Print A;" divided by ";B;" is ";A/B
 Loop
 Rem Error Handler
 Procedure HELP
  Print
  Print "Sorry, you have tried to divide"
  Print "your number by zero."
 Resume Next: <comment>Rem Go back to input</comment>
End Proc
</code>

    <p>
        When using a procedure to deal with errors, and you want to jump to a particular label, a special
        marker must be placed inside that procedure. This is achieved with the RESUME LABEL
        structure.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="str-resume-label">RESUME LABEL</h3>
    <p><i>structure: jump to a label after an error has been isolated using a procedure</i><br>
        <b>Resume Label</b> label</p>

    <p>
        This defines the label which is to be returned to after an error. It must be called outside of your
        error handler, immediately after the original ON ERROR PROC or ON ERROR GOTO
        statement. For an example of RESUME LABEL, please see the last routine in this Chapter.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-errn">ERRN</h3>
    <p><i>function: return the error code number of the last error</i><br>
        number=<b>Errn</b><br>
        Print <b>Errn</b></p>

    <p>
        When you use ON ERROR to create error handling routines, you will want to know exactly
        what sort of error has happened in the main program. Errors discovered while your program is
        running each have a specific error code number, and the number of the last error to be isolated
        can be returned by using the ERRN function.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-error">ERROR</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: deliberately generate an error and return to Editor</i><br>
        <b>Error</b> number</p>

    <p>
        Supposing you have set up an error handling routine and you want to test your programming
        skills. The ERROR command offers a simple method of simulating various mistakes without all
        the inconvenience of waiting for them to happen. To test this system, select the error of your
        choice using the error code numbers listed in the next Chapter. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Error 88</code>

    <p>
        That will quit your program and display a Disc full error message, simulating what would
        happen when your current disc gets filled with data. You may also combine ERROR with the
        ERRN function, to print out the current error condition, after a problem in your program:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Error Errn</code>

    <p>
        Finally, ERROR can be used with RESUME LABEL inside an error handling routine, to jump
        straight back to a label set up with the previous command. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">On Error Proc HELP
Resume Label WELCOME
Error 88
Print "This line is never printed"
WELCOME : Print "Hello! Hello! I'm back again!"
End
Procedure HELP
 Print "There seems to be an error!"
 Resume Label
Endproc
</code>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-trap">TRAP</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: trap an error</i><br>
        <b>Trap</b> instruction</p>

    <p>
        The TRAP command offers a much sleeker error-trapping service than an ON ERROR GOTO
        structure, and it is used to detect errors for a particular instruction. The TRAP instruction is used
        before any normal AMOS Professional instruction with no colon between them, and it disables
        the error system for the specified instruction. This means that if an error occurs, the program
        will not be halted, but the number of the error will be reported instead. This number can then be
        returned by the ERRTRAP function, explained below. Here is an example of trapping a disc
        access error:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Trap Load "File.Abk",10
If Errtrap : Print "Disc Error!" : End If
</code>

    <p>
        TRAP will only detect an error for the instruction that immediately follows, so in the next
        example the second usage of the LOCATE instruction <b>will</b> cause an error!</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Trap Locate -1,-1 : Locate -1,-1</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-errtrap">ERRTRAP</h3>
    <p><i>function: return an error code number after a TRAP</i><br>
        number=<b>Errtrap</b></p>

    <p>
        This function is used to return the error status after a previous TRAP command. If no error has
        been detected, a zero is returned, otherwise the appropriate error number is given. The related
        error message can then be returned using the ERR$ function, explained next.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-err-dollar">ERR$</h3>
    <p><i>function: return an error message string</i><br>
        text$=<b>Err$</b>(error number)</p>

    <p>
        This simple function returns an error message string. If the error number is out of range, then an
        empty string will be given. ERR$ will return error messages as long as they are loaded in
        memory, but messages will not be returned from a compiled program, or if the Editor has been
        KILLed.</p>
