<h1>Welcome</h1>

<br>
<p>I remember my first glimpse of AMOS Basic, three years ago. A
package popped through my
letter box containing a three-and-a-half-inch disc bearing the label
AMOS-1 written in biro. Ten
minutes later I was completely hooked! All through the next year, new
versions arrived on my
welcome mat, and I never quite knew what to expect. It was like opening
Christmas presents
every week! There were many surprises along the way, including the AMAL
animation language, but the potential of the system was obvious from that first
disc. As the project drew to a close, I resolved to get down to some
serious AMOS programming. Three years and several
hundred programs later, I'm still raring to go!</p>

<p>It looks like Christmas has arrived early this year, and I'm
even more enthusiastic about AMOS
Professional. It heralds an exciting new chapter in the world of Amiga
programming, and I'm
delighted to be part of it. There are dozens of great new features, and
I have already
programmed each and every one of them. AMOS has provided me with years
of enjoyment,
and AMOS Professional promises more to come. So join me on an extended
journey into the
fascinating world of AMOS Programming. you won't regret it!</p>

<p>When I first became interested in computers, they were an
unknown quantity. Friends would
ask me, "What can you do with a computer?", and there I was for six
hours a night with my
ZX80, 1k RAM, no colour, no sound, no graphics, writing 101 different
programs that printed
my name to the screen. At the time I didn't have an answer to their
questions.
About twenty years have passed since I plugged in my first transformer,
and home computers
have evolved into powerful and complex beasts. AMOS Professional is the
tamer of my beast,
and with a little effort on your part, I'm sure it will become one of
your best friends as well.
Since using the AMOS system, I have the perfect answer to the old
question "What can you do
with a computer?" I simply reply, "Anything I like!"</p>

I was a computing crustacean: a creature with an interesting past and
possibly extinct. I evolved
from the digital slime when computers were as big as a whale and as
daft as plankton. Two
years ago They said to me "This is an Amiga, and this is Easy AMOS. If
someone like you can
understand how the two go together, then anyone can!" I understood. I
evolved. There were
only three things wrong with Easy AMOS: it was sleeker, smarter and
friendlier than its big
brother AMOS. So now They have come up with AMOS Professional. I can
understand this too.
I have evolved some more. <br>

Now I'm a computing dolphin: streamlined,
intelligent, well-loved
and a protected species. Thanks everyone.</p>
