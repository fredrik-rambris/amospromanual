<h1>Welcome</h1>

<br>

<p>There are four different pointers that can appear at the
left-hand side of the page, and they have the following meanings:</p>


<p>DP&gt; Disc Pointer. Please load this ready-made demonstration program
from disc.<br></p>

<p>E &gt; Edit Pointer. This printed example can be typed in
exactly as it appears on the page, from the AMOS Professional Edit Screen. It can
then be Run, and is seen on screen.</p>

<p>D&gt; Direct Mode Pointer. This printed example can be
typed in exactly as it appears on<br>
the page, from the AMOS Professional Direct Mode Window. It can then be
demonstrated by pressing the [Return] key.</p>

<p>X&gt; This printed example demonstrates a particular
programming technique
or part of a routine. There is no need to type it in, because it cannot
be
demonstrated in isolation on the screen.</p>

<p>Printed examples of AMOS Professional programs appear in
special type, and
they are indented on the page like this:</p>
<pre>
E&gt;AMOS=1
  Print AMOS
</pre>

<p>AMOS Professional provides over seven hundred command words
ready to be
exploited in your own programming routines, and many of them are
staggeringly
powerful. Because these command words are so important, they are
printed in
prominent type throughout this User Guide. When they appear in the main
body
of the text, they are printed in capital letters. For example the
simple
command word for printing items appears as PRINT. Where a command word
is
introduced for the first time in the User Guide, it is indented on the
page
and printed in large bold type, along with a summary of its use. For
example:</p>

<p><b>PRINT</b><br>
<i>instruction: print items on screen</i><br>
<b>Print</b> items</p>

<p>Everything else is fully explained as it is introduced, or is
completely
self-explanatory. Now that AMOS Professional has been introduced to
you, and
before introducing AMOS Professional to your Amiga, here are a few
words of
welcome from some of the key players in the team.</p>

<p><b>A few words of welcome</b><br>
Welcome to AMOS Professional! Many thanks for buying it and
many more thanks for helping us create it. Since your feedback from the very
first versions of AMOS, we have had one constant policy of listening to you,
the user. We have read every letter, and recorded all your comments,
suggestions, bouquets and custard pies! Everything has been evaluated and taken into
account, and the result is in your hands right now.</p>
