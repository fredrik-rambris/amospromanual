<h1>Welcome</h1>

<br>

<p><b>AMOS Professional</b><br>
Welcome to AMOS Professional, the dedicated creation system for producing
professional Amiga programs. With this system at your fingertips, you can
exploit the full potential of your computer, and release the full creativity
of your own imagination. There is not a single style of best-selling computer
game that cannot be produced with AMOS Professional, and by reading through
this User Guide and examining the hundreds of ready-made examples on disc,
you will soon discover that all of the hard work has been done for you.</p>


<p>AMOS Professional has evolved over several years until it can now provide
beginners and experts alike with full control over superb graphics,
animation, audio sampling, synthetic speech, menus, interactive control
panels, and above all, ideas! Most importantly, you can customise AMOS
Professional to suit all your own needs, quickly, simply and precisely.</p>


<p>If you get into any sort of trouble, AMOS Professional offers instant
on-screen Help with every command and aspect of your programming, and there
is even a built-in Program Monitor to examine what is happening within your
routines.</p>


<p>Experienced AMOS users will be amazed how many new features and
improvements have been added to the original system. Beginners will probably
take it all for granted!</p>


<p><b>How to exploit this User Guide</b><br>

A system that has been designed to satisfy all Amiga programming needs must
offer its facilities clearly and simply, otherwise the sheer scale of the
package can seem overwhelming, and some of the system's wonders may be
completely overlooked by the user. To make this User Guide as helpful as
possible, it has been divided into a series of self-contained Sections, and
each Section deals with a specific aspect of the AMOS Professional system.
Where these Sections cover several related subjects, each subject is examined
in its own Chapter.</p>


<p>The number of the current Section and Chapter appears at the top corner of
each page, with the page number printed at the bottom corner. For example,
this is page one of Section 1, Chapter 1, so if it appeared in the Index, it
would be referred to as <a href="101.html">1.1.01</a>, whereas the first page
of Chapter 8 in Section 5 would be referred to as <a href="../5/569.html">5.8.01</a>.</p>


<p>However, the printed word can never convey the look and feel of a
programming technique, which is why everything that you read in these pages
can also be demonstrated and analysed on screen, at the touch of a button!
AMOS Professional comes complete with pre-programmed instant examples of
everything from a single command to complete arcade games, strategy
simulations and practical utilities!</p>


<p>Normally, you will be able to call for ready-made demonstrations and Help
directly, but where it is necessary to load a particular demonstration
program from a disc, a special pointer symbol is used in this User Guide.
Similar pointers also appear to make it clear which examples you can type
in.</p>
