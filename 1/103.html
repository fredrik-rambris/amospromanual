<h1>Welcome</h1>

<br>

<p>
So much has been added to the original software, and special attention
has been paid to the
interface between our software and your brain: the Editor.<br>
I really want you to be comfortable
within AMOS Professional, and I am happy to tell you that the Editor
can be reconfigured to exactly how you like it, and I mean exactly.
You can even reprogram my menu options.
</p>

<p>
We'll keep on listening to your suggestions, so please fill in the
Registration Card and when you
have taken a little time to discover the insides of AMOS Professional,
tell us your impressions of the product. Old AMOS users, you are in for
a big shock! New users, I want you to be surprised, delighted and made
passionate by my software!</p>

<p>
Is it really five years since two French guys visited our offices with
STOS Basic in tow? It had
sold a couple of thousand units in France and all its support programs
looked terrible! But there
was something magical under the hood: STOS had an amazingly fast
sprite engine, a powerful
music facility, and it was perfect for writing games. We got incredibly
excited, decided to publish STOS in the UK as The Games Creator, and
got the author to write a Low res sprite editor and a game, for which
we supplied all the graphics. STOS was transformed! It was launched in
August 1988 and stormed straight to Number One in the Gallup Charts. It
has since sold 40,000 copies through the shops, and a further 90,000
when Atari bundled it with the ST for a year.<br>

AMOS was started soon after the STOS launch. Until then,
Fran&ccedil;ois had hardly seen an Amiga,
and boy, did he have problems coming to terms with its idiosyncrasies!
Since then, AMOS has
transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Amiga programmers!
Easy AMOS followed
on, to meet the demands of first-time programmers. Fran&ccedil;ois made so
many improvements to
the original environment that we had to give AMOS a complete overhaul,
and the result is
AMOS Professional: what must be the most sophisticated development
system for the Amiga
yet.

I am sure that as you use AMOS Pro you will appreciate the sheer
amount of hard work and
love that Fran&ccedil;ois, Richard, Mel, Stephen, Ronnie and the
team have put into the package. They
have worked long hours, seven days a week to bring you their pride and
joy, based on
conversations and questionnaires from very many AMOS users. I hope that
this is exactly what
you've been waiting for, and I wish you many happy hours using AMOS Pro
to transform your dreams into reality.</p>

<p>I've been involved with AMOS from the very beginning. It's been a
wonderful program to work
with and I have always been excited by each new version created by
Fran&ccedil;ois. With AMOS
Professional we have turned the tables on you, the user. Instead of
dictating what this new
version was to be, we contacted over two hundred AMOS enthusiasts to
see what they wanted.
From their replies we created a Wish List of major features.
The ones that made the most sense
and offered the greatest benefits to the majority of users were grafted
into the system. AMOS is
a very wholesome product, and it leaves no boulders unturned. Its
creative powers allow you to
produce endless types of programs. Have strength in all your
programming efforts, and if your
human machine tries to defeat you and you feel like giving up, rely on
the strength of AMOS
Professional. The satisfaction is well worth the effort. Go for it!</p>
