<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p>You should tag the number of the destination screen to the LOAD IFF command like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Load Iff "filename", number
</pre>

<p><b>Can't open narrator (185)</b><br>
AMOS Professional is unable to find "narrator.device" in the current "devs:" directory, so the
narrator program cannot be loaded.</p>

<p><b>Can't resume to a label (4)</b><br>
You cannot use RESUME label inside an error procedure.</p>

<p><b>Can't set dual playfield (70)</b><br>
The screens you are using are not suitable for setting up a dual playfield. The correct screen
combinations are explained under the DUAL PLAYFIELD section of this User Guide.</p>

<p><b>Command not supported by device (143)</b><br>
This error is returned by the DEV DO and DEV SEND commands. A command has been sent
that is not supported. Check with Commodore's documentation.</p>

<p><b>Copper list too long (77)</b><br>
The user-defined copper list has a pre-set limit of 12k. This may be extended using the [Set
Interpreter] option from the [Config] menu.</p>

<p><b>Copper not disabled (76)</b><br>
You are not allowed to use the COP MOVE or COP SWAP commands before disabling the
normal copper list with COPPER OFF.</p>

<p><b>Device already opened (140)</b><br>
You've tried to open the same device twice. The PRINTER and PARALLEL devices can only be
opened once in any particular session. If you're using multi-tasking, check that another
application hasn't grabbed the device first. If so, you'll have to quit from the application before
running your AMOS program.</p>

<p><b>Device cannot be opened (142)</b><br>
The selected device cannot be opened for use. Make sure that it's correctly connected, and that
the appropriate device drivers are available from the DEVS folder of your current start-up disc.</p>

<p><b>Device error (144)</b><br>
A device has reported a device specific error. AMOS Professional cannot keep all possible errors
in memory so check with Commodore documentation for the correct error meaning.</p>

<p><b>Device not available (86)</b><br>
You have specified a disc or a drive, but your Amiga does not believe that it exists, possibly
because you have changed a disc unexpectedly. You can set the directory to the correct drive
name with an instruction such as:</p>

<pre>
X> Dir$="Df0:"
</pre>

<div align="right"> <a href="1221.html">Back</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;
