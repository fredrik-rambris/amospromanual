<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Time-out error (155)</b><br>
The SERIAL INPUTS command or SERIAL GET command have waited in vain for information
over the serial channel. They've finally aborted with an error. Check that everything is
connected correctly, and that the other end of the communications line is actually sending you
some data. This time-out limit can be set from the Workbench Preferences.</p>

<p><b>Too many colours in flash (51)</b><br>
There is a maximum allowance of 16 colour changes in a single FLASH command.</p>

<p><b>Type mismatch (34)</b><br>
An illegal value has been assigned to a variable. The following line shows two classic Type
mismatch errors:</p>

<pre>
X> A$=23 : B="A string into an integer?"
</pre>

<p><b>User cancelled request (161)</b><br>
The printer was not available to the printer device, a system requester appeared and you clicked
on Cancel and then this error occurred.</p>

<p><b>User function not defined (15)</b><br>
There's a problem with a user defined function created with DEF FN. AMOS can't find the
function you are referring to. Check that you've defined your function earlier in your program
with DEF FN. This line must occur BEFORE your FN function actually appears in the listing!
You can't create your function as part of a procedure, or a subroutine.</p>

<p><b>Valid screen numbers range from 0 to 7 (50)</b><br>
There is a maximum of eight screens that can be opened at any one time.</p>

<p><b>Wave 0 and 1 are reserved (182)</b><br>
Waves 0 and 1 are automatically reserved for white noise and pure tones respectively. So you
can't redefine them using the SET WAVE command.</p>

<p><b>Window already opened (55)</b><br>
It is impossible to open a window that is already open.</p>

<p><b>Window not opened (54)</b><br>
You are trying to access a window that does not exist, because it has not been opened.</p>

<p><b>Window too large (57)</b><br>
It is impossible to open the requested window, because its dimensions are too large to fit into
the current screen.</p>

<p><b>Window too small (56)</b><br>
The requested window is smaller than the minimum permitted size. Please see WIND OPEN
and WIND SIZE for a full explanation.</p>
