<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Sample not defined (179)</b><br>
The sample that you want to play does not exist in the current sample bank.</p>

<p><b>Sample bank not found (180)</b><br>
There is no sample bank in memory.</p>

<p><b>Screen already in double buffering (69)</b><br>
You cannot call DOUBLE BUFFER more than once on the same screen.</p>

<p><b>Screen not in dual playfield mode (71)</b><br>
You may only use DUAL PRIORITY after creating a dual playfield.</p>

<p><b>Screen not opened (47)</b><br>
You must open a screen with the SCREEN OPEN command before it can be accessed.</p>

<p><b>Screens can't be ANIMated (67)</b><br>
AMAL can only move or scroll screens. It is impossible to animate screens using the built in Anim
command.</p>

<p><b>Scrolling zone not defined (72)</b><br>
Before using the SCROLL command, the direction and size of the scrolling area must be defined
with SET SCROLL.</p>

<p><b>Selected unit already in use (160)</b><br>
The unit number can be specified for Serial communications and this error will occur if the
requested unit is in use. You'll need to have a special multi-serial board though!</p>

<p><b>Serial device already in use (145)</b><br>
Another application is using the serial device and has forbidden access to other programs.</p>

<p><b>Shift declaration error (53)</b><br>
There is a mistake in the colour sequence used in a SHIFT UP or SHIFT DOWN instruction.</p>

<p><b>Sprite error (105)</b><br>
The values entered into a SPRITE command are outside of the required limits. Check this User
Guide for the correct parameters.</p>

<p><b>String too long (21)</b><br>
AMOS Professional allows a maximum of 65000 characters in any string.</p>

<p><b>Syntax error in animation string (107)</b><br>
There is an error in the animation sequence specified by an Anim command. Check for typing
errors, especially for full stops instead of commas.</p>

<p><b>Text window 0 can't be closed (62)</b><br>
The WIND CLOSE command can only close windows which have been defined using WIND
OPEN. So it won't close the original text window.</p>

<p><b>This window has no border (63)</b><br>
A BORDER command has been used on a window which has no border.</p>
