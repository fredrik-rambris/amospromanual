<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Menu item not defined (39)</b><br>
The item specified in a MENU command has not been previously defined using MENU$.</p>

<p><b>Menu not opened (38)</b><br>
The MENU ON command has been called, but no menu has been previously defined using the
MENU$ or MAKE MENU BANK instruction.</p>

<p><b>Music bank not defined (184)</b><br>
There is no music bank in memory.</p>

<p><b>Music bank not found (183)</b><br>
The Music that you want to play does not exist in the current music bank.</p>

<p><b>Next without For in animation string (108)</b><br>
In an AMAL animation string, each Next command must be associated with a single For
statement. Also check the upper and lower case of any comments in your AMAL program.</p>

<p><b>No data set ready (157)</b><br>
A strange error message generated by Commodore's Serial device. We think it may happen
when the serial device just cannot handle the incoming data. Let us know if you know better!</p>

<p><b>No ON ERROR PROC before this instruction (5)</b><br>
You can only use RESUME LABEL after an ON ERROR PROC command.</p>

<p><b>No data after this label (41)</b><br>
You cannot RESTORE the data pointer to a line with no DATA statements on that line or
subsequent lines.</p>

<p><b>No disc in drive (93)</b><br>
Your Amiga does not believe that there is a disc in the drive you want to access. Try again.</p>

<p><b>No programs below current program (43)</b><br>
You are trying to BGRAB a bank, but the current program has not been installed as an accessory.</p>

<p><b>No message waiting (197)</b><br>
You've tried to answer a message with AREXX ANSWER which has not actually been received.
You may need to add an AREXX WAIT command before your instruction. Also check that
you've opened the correct Arexx communications port.</p>

<p><b>No zones defined (73)</b><br>
This is an error generated by the RESET ZONE command. RESET ZONE erases all the zone
definitions you've created using SET ZONE. It can only be called after you've reserved some
memory for your zones with RESERVE ZONE.</p>

<p><b>Non dimensioned array (27)</b><br>
You are trying to refer to an array, but it has not yet been defined.</p>
