<h1>Error Handling</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>RESUME LABEL</b><br>
<i>structure: jump to a label after an error has been isolated using a procedure</i><br>
<b>Resume Label</b> label</p>

<p>
This defines the label which is to be returned to after an error. It must be called outside of your
error handler, immediately after the original ON ERROR PROC or ON ERROR GOTO
statement. For an example of RESUME LABEL, please see the last routine in this Chapter.</p>

<p>
<b>ERRN</b><br>
<i>function: return the error code number of the last error</i><br>
number=<b>Errn</b><br>
Print <b>Errn</b></p>

<p>
When you use ON ERROR to create error handling routines, you will want to know exactly
what sort of error has happened in the main program. Errors discovered while your program is
running each have a specific error code number, and the number of the last error to be isolated
can be returned by using the ERRN function.</p>

<p>
<b>ERROR</b><br>
<i>instruction: deliberately generate an error and return to Editor</i><br>
<b>Error</b> number</p>

<p>
Supposing you have set up an error handling routine and you want to test your programming
skills. The ERROR command offers a simple method of simulating various mistakes without all
the inconvenience of waiting for them to happen. To test this system, select the error of your
choice using the error code numbers listed in the next Chapter. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Error 88
</pre>

<p>
That will quit your program and display a Disc full error message, simulating what would
happen when your current disc gets filled with data. You may also combine ERROR with the
ERRN function, to print out the current error condition, after a problem in your program:</p>

<pre>
X> Error Errn
</pre>

<p>
Finally, ERROR can be used with RESUME LABEL inside an error handling routine, to jump
straight back to a label set up with the previous command. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> On Error Proc HELP
   Resume Label WELCOME
   Error 88
   Print "This line is never printed"
   WELCOME : Print "Hello! Hello! I'm back again!"
   End
   Procedure HELP
    Print "There seems to be an error!"
    Resume Label
   Endproc
</pre>
