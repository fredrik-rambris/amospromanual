<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Program already running</b><br>
This will occur if a program trys to PRUN itself.</p>

<p><b>Program is not an accessory</b><br>
You are using Accessory specific commands (ASK EDITOR, CALL EDITOR etc.) within
program that is not an Accessory. To be an Accessory, a program must include SET ACCESSORY
at the beginning of its code and also be called from the Editor menus.</p>

<p><b>Sorry! Editor configuration not recoverable!</b><br>
AMOS Professional has attempted a Warm-start. In order to work it needs to be able to find the
"AMOSPro.LastSession" file from the APSystem folder. If this is corrupted, or write-protected,
you'll get an error when you try to load AMOS Professional. If you've write-protected the disc,
remove the protection, and try again. If it still fails to load, delete the "AMOSPro.LastSession"
file from the CLI and re-boot. AMOS Professional should now load correctly.</p>

<p><b>Syntax error</b><br>
The current line of your program is written wrongly. You must have the correct syntax or
"grammar" for the construction you are trying to use, as explained in this User Guide.</p>

<p><b>Text buffer too small</b><br>
The SET TEXT BUFFER command from the Editor menu will not allow you to set the text buffer
smaller than 1024 bytes. Try a higher value.</p>

<p><b>Too many direct mode variables</b><br>
Normally, you are allowed to create up to 64 new variables while in direct mode. If your
program is using too much memory, space in the variable table may become restricted.</p>

<p><b>This editor command needs a string</b><br>
An ASK EDITOR or a CALL EDITOR command has been used with the wrong sort of
parameters. It was expecting a string, but you've entered a number instead.</p>

<p><b>This file is not an AMOSPro Macro file!</b><br>
The [Load Macros] option from the [Project/Macro] menu has attempted to load a file which is
in the wrong format.</p>

<p><b>This function cannot be used in a macro!</b><br>
When you're creating a Macro, you're not allowed to call up any existing Macro definitions from
the keyboard. If you try, you'll get a dialogue box with this error, and your Macro definition will
be aborted.</p>

<p><b>This key is not assigned to a macro!</b><br>
The macro definition you've attempted to delete with [Erase Macro] does not exist! You've
probably made a typing mistake.</p>

<p><b>This is not a relocatable executable routine!</b><br>
You've attempted to use INSERT PROGRAM to install the wrong type of program into a
procedure. This program file must contain a 68000 machine code routine in PC relative
(relocatable) format. Programs created with the AMOS Compiler are NOT acceptable!</p>
