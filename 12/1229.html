<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Not an AmigaDOS disc (92)</b><br>
AMOS Professional can only read discs created on an Amiga. If you want to use discs that are of
compatible size but originate from another sort of computer, you will first have to use
specialised software to translate the data.</p>

<p><b>Not a med module (189)</b><br>
The MED LOAD command is only capable of loading music modules which are compatible with
the MED music format. So check that the music is in the correct format.</p>

<p><b>Not a packed bitmap (200)</b><br>
You have attempted to unpack a data bank which is not in bitmap format.</p>

<p><b>Not a packed screen (201)</b><br>
The data you are trying to unpack is not in packed screen format.</p>

<p><b>Not a tracker module (186)</b><br>
The TRACKER LOAD command is only capable of loading music modules which are compatible
with the popular NOISETRACKER music format.</p>

<p><b>Out of data (33)</b><br>
You may have left out some information from one of your DATA lines, because a READ
command has gone past the last item of data in the current program. Alternatively, there may be
a typing error in a RESTORE command.</p>

<p><b>Out of internal memory (printer device) (167)</b><br>
The printer device cannot cope with what you've requested. This Commodore internal error
may vary upon the device.</p>

<p><b>Out of memory (24)</b><br>
Your Amiga thinks that it has run out of available memory storage space. If the information line
assures you that there is plenty of spare memory, simply save your program, re-boot and load
the program back in. There are commands which will free up memory when you start reaching
the Amiga's limits. These are: CLOSE EDITOR, KILL EDITOR and CLOSE WORKBENCH.</p>

<p><b>Out of memory (parallel device 172), (printer device 166), ( serial device 148)</b><br>
If a device requires memory and finds that there's no more left, one of the above will be
reported back. Try adding the CLOSE WORKBENCH or CLOSE EDITOR commands at the start
of your program to free up some additional memory.</p>

<p><b>Out of stack space (0)</b><br>
There are too many procedure calls nested inside one another. Although AMOS Professional
procedures can call themselves up, this error may be reported after about 50 loops. The same
can happen with the GOSUB command. See the SET STACK command if you need to extend
this limit.</p>

<p><b>Out of variable space (11)</b><br>
Normally, AMOS Professional allocates 8k of storage space for your strings and arrays.
To increase variable space, use the SET BUFFER command at the beginning
of your program.</p>
