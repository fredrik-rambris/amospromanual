<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>UNTIL without REPEAT</b><br>
You have used an UNTIL command that does not refer to a previous REPEAT statement.</p>

<p><b>Undefined label</b><br>
Your program is trying to find a label that you have forgotten to specify.</p>

<p><b>Undefined procedure</b><br>
You are trying to call up a procedure that does not exist in your program.</p>

<p><b>Use empty brackets when defining a shared array</b><br>
You are not allowed to include the dimensions of an array when you define it as SHARED.</p>

<p><b>User function not defined</b><br>
You've probably tried to call a non-existent user defined function from direct mode. Note that
Direct mode can access any User Defined functions created by your current program. Providing
they've been installed in memory with a RUN, they can be used with impunity.</p>

<p><b>Variable buffer can't be changed in the middle of a program!</b><br>
Apart from a REM statement, the SET BUFFER command must always be used as the very first
line of your program.</p>

<p><b>Variable buffer too small</b><br>
While you are running a [Test] on your program, it is possible that the area reserved for
variables can overflow. If there is enough memory available, use SET BUFFER to expand this
area.</p>

<p><b>WEND without WHILE</b><br>
There is no WHILE command to go with your WEND statement.</p>

<p><b>WHILE without matching WEND</b><br>
There is no matching WEND statement to go with your WHILE command.</p>

<p><b>Run time errors</b><br>

When AMOS Professional comes across a mistake while your program is running, it will
automatically halt the program, pinpoint the offending instruction and display the relevant
error message. As soon as you continue editing your program, the cursor will go to the line in
your program where the error is lurking. These run time errors each have a special code
number, which is displayed in brackets immediately after the error message, and these code
numbers can be used in the process of error trapping. For example, you may want to find the
error message that goes with a particular code number, by using a line such as:</p>

<pre>
X> Error Errornumber
</pre>

<p><b>256 characters for a wave (181)</b><br>
Audio waves can only be created by a list of 256 bytes.</p>

<p><b>Address error (25)</b><br>
You are trying to read an odd address in a DEEK or LEEK command, which must
always be even. Similarly, DOKE and LOKE cannot load these addresses.</p>
