<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p>
AMOS Professional offers several sets of error messages to help you correct your programming
mistakes. Editing error messages may appear while you are in the middle of programming.
Program error messages can happen when you test your work. Run time messages come
complete with their own number code, and they pinpoint errors while your program is running.
Error messages appear in the information line of your screen, and are automatically displayed to
help and inform you.</p>

<p><b>Editing error messages</b><br>

While you are editing programs, one of the following messages may appear.</p>

<p><b>Bottom of text</b><br>
The text cursor has come to the last line of your current program.</p>

<p><b>Cannot delete warm-start information!</b><br>
You've tried to use AMOS Warm-start system on a Write protected disc. AMOS won't reload
until the "AMOSPro.LastSession" has been successfully deleted. Remove the protection and try
again. If the problem persists, you'll have to delete the file manually. It's in the APSystem folder.</p>

<p><b>Cannot hide the last window</b><br>
AMOS Professional always requires at least one window on the screen at any one time. So you
can't hide the final window away as an accessory.</p>

<p><b>Cannot load configuration</b><br>
If you've tried to load a new configuration using the option in the [Config] menu, and the file
you have selected is not valid then this error will be generated. It will also appear in the CLI or
Workbench if AMOS Professional cannot load the default configuration when it is being booted
or re-loaded after a KILL EDITOR command. A backup copy of the default configuration file can
be found in the Extra_Configs folder on the AMOSPro System disc.</p>

<p><b>Cannot load included file</b><br>
The INCLUDE command can't find your chosen include file. Check that it's available in one of
your drives.</p>

<p><b>Cannot save configuration</b><br>
AMOS can't save your configuration file onto your start-up disc. This error can occur if you've
selected the [Save Configuration] feature from the [Quit Options] menu or when saving from
the menu item in the [Config] menu. If there's not enough space on your boot-disc, or it's write
protected, you'll get an error.</p>

<p><b>Cannot save editor set-up: warm start not enabled</b><br>
AMOS Professional cannot save the AMOSPro.LastSession file or cannot save one of the
program files being worked on. This can happen for many reasons - disc protected, no disc in
drive, disc full etc. If this happens, the next warm-start procedure is aborted and the next time
you boot up you'll have an empty editor.</p>

<p><b>Disc error</b><br>
The Editor has been unable to load a configuration file, include file, or library from the
current disc. If the file is on a floppy, try re-inserting it a couple of times. If all else
fails, use DISCDOCTOR to salvage your data and try again with a fresh disc.</p>
