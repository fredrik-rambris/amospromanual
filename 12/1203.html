<h1>the Monitor</h1>

<br>

<b>The Graphic Output Window</b><br>

The window that occupies the top left-hand quarter of the Monitor Screen displays the graphic
output of the current program screen. The screen number is displayed above it. Lowres screens
are reduced to exactly half of their original size, so that a 320x200 screen fits perfectly into this
window. If the screen is larger than this default size, it can be explored using the four directional
arrow icons in the push-button control panel. Hires screens are <b>not</b> reduced, and these are also
examined using the direction arrows.</p>

<p>
All colour animations, including FLASH and FADE will be shown during the monitoring
process. If the current screen features more than 16 colours, then colours 16 to 31, colours 41 to
47 and colours 48 to 63 will each be converted to colours 0 to 15. Obviously HAM pictures may
well generate some bizarre displays.</p>

<p>
Experiment with the directional arrows, and then click anywhere in the graphic output window
with the left mouse button. This returns to the original program display for as long as the button
remains pressed, and is a useful feature to-remind you of exactly what is on the screen you are
dealing with.</p>

<p><b>The Program Listing Window</b><br>

This window gives you a view of the current program listing. Any items to be examined can be
marked out, but nothing in this window can be changed. Once the Monitor has been initialised,
helpful markers will be shown in the program listing, acting as reminders for the following
points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The current program location is marked by a black cursor with three small arrow-heads. It
      always appears before the <b>next</b> instruction to be examined.</li>
  <li>You are allowed to set a "break point" in the listing, and these are marked in <b>inverse video</b>.</li>
  <li>Any item that you want information about will be <b>underlined</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Information Window</b><br>

This is where all of the Monitor information appears. It commences by displaying the next
instruction to be examined, but as more of the Monitor features become active, information is
displayed in the following order, from top to bottom in this window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Error messages</li>
  <li>Information on instructions</li>
  <li>The next instruction to be examined</li>
  <li>The first parameter of the next instruction</li>
  <li>The second parameter, the third parameter, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Changing the window displays</b><br>

Scroll bars are provided to move the display of the program listing, vertically and horizontally in
the Program Listing Window. The "centre" button at the top right-hand corner of this window is
used to centre the display on the <b>next</b> instruction to be executed. A vertical scroll bar is also
available for the Information Window.</p>
