<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Bank already reserved (35)</b><br>
You have tried to create a memory bank that already exists.</p>

<p><b>Bank not reserved (36)</b><br>
The bank that you are trying to select has not been created using RESERVE. This error message
can also result from certain commands trying to use data from a specific memory bank
automatically, such as SAMPLAY.</p>

<p><b>Block not defined (46)</b><br>
You've tried to use the PUT BLOCK command with a non-existent Block number. Call GET
BLOCK to grab some blocks into memory.</p>

<p><b>Block not found (65)</b><br>
You cannot specify a block without first creating it, using GET BLOCK.</p>

<p><b>Bob not defined (68)</b><br>
You cannot manipulate a Bob without first setting it up using a BOB command.</p>

<p><b>Bordered windows not on edge of screen (59)</b><br>
You are not allowed to position a window at the edge of a screen, but must leave at least eight
pixels between them, to allow space for the border.</p>

<p><b>Break detected (159)</b><br>
The device you are communicating with has aborted the present serial operation.</p>

<p><b>Buffer overflow (156)</b><br>
The SERIAL SEND or SERIAL INPUT commands have run out of buffer space. Increase the
amount of memory with SERIAL BUFFER and try again.</p>

<p><b>Cannot load med.library (187)</b><br>
You've tried to use the MED PLAYER commands without installing the med.library file in the
LIBS folder of your current start-up disc. A copy can be found on the AMOSPro System disc.</p>

<p><b>Cannot open Arexx port (195)</b><br>
You've tried to open a busy AREXX port with AREXX OPEN. Check that you've entered it in the
correct format. The name should be in UPPER CASE. You should find a usable port with the
=AREXX EXIST function.</p>

<p><b>Cannot open library (170)</b><br>
LIB OPEN can't find the requested library in the LIBS folder of your start-up disc. Make sure it's
there.</p>

<p><b>Cannot start med.library (188)</b><br>
The med.library requires all sound channels to be unused before it can be opened. So AMOS
Professional makes a check and if all four channels are clear the library is opened.</p>

<p><b>Can't fit picture in current screen (32)</b><br>
You have tried to use LOAD I FF to load a picture into an existing screen of a different
type. AMOS Professional will automatically create a screen of the right type if
you specify a screen number in the correct range of 0 to 7.</p>
