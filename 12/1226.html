<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Illegal print dimensions (164)</b><br>
The PRINTER DUMP command is unable to print your screen with the selected dimensions.
Check for a mistake in the "special" parameter. This can have a dramatic effect on the size of
your screen on the actual paper.</p>

<p><b>Illegal screen parameter (48)</b><br>
You have specified dimensions using SCREEN OPEN that are not acceptable. Your minimum
screen size can be as small as 32x8, and the maximum is 1024x1024 pixels.</p>

<p><b>Illegal user function call (16)</b><br>
You've made an error in either a user defined function, as created by the DEF FN command.
The most likely mistake is that you've entered the wrong number of variables in your FN
statement.</p>

<p><b>Illegal window parameter (60)</b><br>
An incorrect value has been entered in one of the WIND or WINDOW commands.</p>

<p><b>Input too long (99)</b><br>
Either your input string is too long for a previously dimensioned variable, or you have tried to
INPUT# a line of more than 1000 characters.</p>

<p><b>Instruction only valid in autotest (112)</b><br>
The Direct or eXit commands can only be used inside an AMAL AUTOTEST.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Bad syntax (120)</b><br>
There's a syntax or typing error in one of your AMOS Interface programs. Use the EDIALOG
function to find the position of your error in the command string.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Channel already defined (124)</b><br>
You've tried to open the same AMOS Interface channel number twice. There's a mistake in one
of the DIALOG OPEN commands in your program.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Channel not defined (125)</b><br>
There's a problem with a DIALOG RUN command in your program. The channel number
you've attempted to execute does not exist. It needs to have been previously assigned to an
AMOS Interface command sequence with a call to DIALOG OPEN.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Illegal function call (128)</b><br>
You've entered the wrong sort of values in one of your AMOS INTERFACE commands. Use
EDIALOG to find the offending command. A full list of all the parameter options can be found
directly from the HELP menu.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Illegal number of parameters (131)</b><br>
You've typed too few, or too many values into one of your AMOS Interface functions. Use
EDIALOG to located the mistake, and the AMOS HELP menu to find the correct number of
parameters for your instruction.</p>
