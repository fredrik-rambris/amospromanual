<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Hardware data overrun (150)</b><br>
This error can be generated if you wait too long before loading your data from the serial port
using SERIAL INPUTS. If there's too much waiting in the wings the serial port can be
overloaded, and the system collapses. Possible solutions include reducing the transfer rate with
SERIAL SPEED, or reading the information a character at a time with SERIAL GET.</p>

<p><b>I/O error (94)</b><br>
The Input/Output error message implies that there is a corrupted file that cannot be accessed
properly. Try again, checking any disc drive connections. If necessary, you may have to resort to
the DISC DOCTOR program, supplied on your original Workbench disc.</p>

<p><b>IFF compression not recognised (31)</b><br>
You are trying to load a screen that has been compressed with an unfamiliar system. Try and re-
save your original screen source in standard IFF format.</p>

<p><b>Icon not defined (74)</b><br>
The icon specified in your instruction cannot be found in the current Icon bank.</p>

<p><b>Invalid baud rate (147)</b><br>
The SERIAL SPEED command only permits you to set the speed to certain values. If the current
serial device doesn't support your value, you'll get this error.</p>

<p><b>Illegal block parameters (66)</b><br>
The values you have entered in a GET BLOCK or PUT BLOCK command are not allowed.</p>

<p><b>Illegal copper parameter (78)</b><br>
The value entered in a COP MOVE, COP MOVEL or COP SWAP instruction is outside of the
permitted range.</p>

<p><b>Illegal direct mode (17)</b><br>
Direct mode only permits you to run certain types of instructions from the command line. All
program control instructions such as FOR. .NEXT, IF. .THEN, GOSUB, and GOTO are forbidden.
In addition, you are NOT allowed to call any AMOS Professional procedures from direct mode.</p>

<p><b>Illegal file name (82)</b><br>
You are trying to use a non-standard file name.</p>

<p><b>Illegal function call (23)</b><br>
There is a mistake with the values in an AMOS Professional command. Return to the editor and
identify the likely command in your line of program. Allowable parameters are all detailed in
this User Guide.</p>

<p><b>Illegal instruction during autotest (115)</b><br>
Check to see if an AUTOTEST has been defined by mistake. If it is intentional, you may have
used an AMAL command such as Move or Anim. Also check the upper and lower case usage of
your AMAL labels.</p>

<p><b>Illegal number of colours (49)</b><br>
You are trying to use the wrong number of colours on screen at once.
Check the syntax of your SCREEN OPEN commands, or check this
User Guide for a full list of available screen colour options.</p>
