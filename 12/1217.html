<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Illegal direct mode</b><br>
Direct mode only permits you to run certain types of instructions from the command line. All
program control instructions such as FOR. .NEXT, IF. .THEN, GOSUB, and GOTO are forbidden.
In addition, you are NOT allowed to call any AMOS Professional procedures from direct mode.</p>

<p><b>Illegal number of parameters</b><br>
You've entered the wrong number of values in one of your AMOS Professional instructions.
You can find the correct syntax using the HELP system. Just position the cursor over the start of
the offending instruction, and hit the HELP key from the keyboard.</p>

<p><b>Included file is not an AMOS program!</b><br>
The AMOS INCLUDE system is only capable of including runnable .AMOS format programs.
You've probably typed the filename wrong.</p>

<p><b>LOOP without DO</b><br>
A LOOP command has been found, but there is no DO statement to trigger it off.</p>

<p><b>Label defined twice</b><br>
A label or procedure can only be defined once in each program.</p>

<p><b>Music bank not defined</b><br>
The music number you are looking for is not in the current music bank.</p>

<p><b>Music bank not found</b><br>
There is no music bank.</p>

<p><b>NEXT without FOR</b><br>
You have forgotten to precede a NEXT instruction with its FOR command.</p>

<p><b>No ELSE IF after an ELSE</b><br>
The ELSE IF statement can only be used between the IF and the ELSE of an IF..ELSE..ENDIF
test. You're not allowed to insert it between the ELSE and the ENDIF.</p>

<p><b>No THEN in a structured test</b><br>
You cannot use IF ... THEN inside a structured test, but you are allowed to make use of IF
...ELSE IF ... ENDIF.</p>

<p><b>No jumps allowed in the middle of a loop!</b><br>
You can only jump out from a loop once you are inside of it. You cannot jump into a loop using
a GOTO or GOSUB statement.</p>

<p><b>Not enough loops to exit</b><br>
You have specified a larger count of loops than the number of active loops available in your
EXIT or EXIT IF command.</p>
