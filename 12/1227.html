<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Interface Error: Label defined twice (122)</b><br>
This is a mistake with the LA or LAbel command in your AMOS Interface program. You appear
to have defined the same label twice with exactly the same value.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Label not defined (123)</b><br>
A JUmp or JS command has been entered in your AMOS Interface program with a non-existent
label number. Labels are defined using the LA command. Unlike AMOS Professional or AMAL,
you're only allowed to use numbers from 1 to 65536. Names are not permitted.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Screen modified (126)</b><br>
After an Interface channel has been opened to a particular screen, the screen has been altered or
closed. Interface stores information about the screen from the start, so you must keep the screen
in the same format.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Type mismatch (129)</b><br>
One of the values in an Interface function is of the wrong type. If you're using a variable, check
that it contains the right sort of data. An Interface variable can be used to store both strings or
numbers. So it's easy to get confused.</p>

<p><b>Interface Error: Variable not defined (127)</b><br>
You've called the VA function with a no existent variable number. Permissible numbers range
from 0 to 65535. However, the system defaults to just 17. You can increase this limit with a
simple option from the DIALOG OPEN command.</p>

<p><b>Invalid parallel parameter (173)</b><br>
There's a problem with one of the parameters you're using with the PARALLEL SEND or
PARALLEL INPUT commands.</p>

<p><b>Jump to/within autotest in animation string (110)</b><br>
It is illegal to Jump directly inside an AUTOTEST from your main AMAL program. To leave an
AUTOTEST, use the eXit or Direct commands instead.</p>

<p><b>Label already defined in animation string (114)</b><br>
Two versions of the same label definition have been discovered in an AMAL program. All labels
must consist of a single upper case letter.</p>

<p><b>Label not defined (40)</b><br>
You have included a label in an instruction, but forgotten to define it. Check for mistakes in
computed GOTO, GOSUB or RESTORE statements.</p>

<p><b>Label not defined in animation string (109)</b><br>
You are attempting to jump to a non-existent label in an AMAL animation string.</p>

<p><b>Library already opened (168)</b><br>
You've tried to open the same library twice with LIB OPEN.</p>

<p><b>Library not opened (169)</b><br>
LIB CALL has been used with a non-existent channel number.
You'll need to open this channel first using LIB OPEN.</p>
