<h1>AMOS Errors</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Not done</b><br>
This "error" is generated when you abort from an operation such as [Load], [New], or [Quit]
I corn the Editor. It's also produced when the editor is unable to comply with your instructions.</p>

<p><b>Not found</b><br>
A SEARCH or REPLACE operation from the Editor has been unable to find your requested
search string.</p>

<p><b>Out of buffer space</b><br>
The AMOS Professional Editor stores each program listing in an internal "memory buffer". If
you run out of space in this buffer, you'll get an "Out of buffer space" error. The solution is to
use the [Set Text Buffer] function from the [Editor] menu to increase the allocation. Each extra
byte can hold a single character in your program listing. Note that providing you INCREASE the
memory buffer, your current program listing will be perfectly safe. If you reduce it however, it
will be erased from memory!</p>

<p>
The most common cause of this problem is when you select the "Automatic Adaptation" option
after loading a large file. This will reserve just 254 bytes for your editing operations. If you click
on [No], AMOS will automatically call [Set Text Buffer] so that you can expand the memory
buffer to a more sensible size.</p>

<p><b>Out of Editor memory</b><br>
You've tried to load an AMOS program which is too large to fit into the available memory. If
you've several windows open, try closing some of them to grab back a little extra space. Don't
forget to save any changes first! Also check the amount of available memory with the
[Information] option from the [Project] menu. If there seems to be plenty of Ram, you've
probably suffered from a memory fragmentation problem. Save your programs, and re-boot
your Amiga from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Out of memory</b><br>
There is no more memory available to hold the current programs. Using the CLOSE
WORKBENCH instruction can restore 40k of memory used by the Workbench screen.</p>

<p><b>Out of memory: Cannot load program</b><br>
This error is generated when there isn't enough memory to hold an accessory program assigned
to one of the Editor options. It's also produced by the PRUN command. The solution is to free
up as much memory as possible by closing any unused windows. If you still can't call the
program, save any changes and re-boot AMOS Professional from scratch. This re-initialises the
Amiga's memory system and provides the maximum storage space your AMOS programs.</p>

<p><b>Please choose a RELOCATABLE PROGRAM!</b><br>
The [Insert Program] option from the [Editor/Procedures] menu only works with 68000 machine
code programs in PC relative (relocatable) format. If you've included instructions which move
directly to a fixed memory location, your assembler will have placed extra relocation information
at the end of your machine code. This cannot be used by AMOS Professional, so your program
will be rejected out of hand.</p>
