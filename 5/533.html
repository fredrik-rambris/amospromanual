<h1>Control Structures</h1>

<br>

<P>Here is a working example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Input "Type values A,B and C: ";A,B,C
   If A=B
      Print "A equals B";
   Else
      Print "A is not equal to B";
      If A&lt;&gt;B And A&lt;&gt;C
         Print "or to C"
      End If
   End If
</pre>

<P>Note how each IF statement must be paired with a single END IF to inform AMOS 
Professional exactly which group of instructions is to be executed inside the test.</P>

<P>
<b>ELSE IF</b><BR>
<i>structure: allow multiple structured tests</i><BR>
<b>If</b> condition <b>Else If</b> multiple conditions ... <b>Else</b> statement <b>End If</b></P>

<P>
This allows multiple tests to be performed. ELSE IF must be used within a normal IF ... 
END IF statement, and the only rule to remember is that there must be one ELSE just before the 
END IF. This sort of test waits for an expression, and if the expression is True, then what comes 
after it is executed. Here is an example:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; If A=1
      Print "A=1"
   Else If A=2
      Print "A=2"
   Else If A=3
      Print "A=3"
   Else
      Print "Something Else"
   End If
</pre>
	
<P>If necessary, an entire test can be placed in a single line, as follows:</P>
<pre>
X&gt; If A=1 : Print "A=1" : Else If A=2 : Print "A=2" : Else : Print "Something Else" : End If<BR>
</pre>

<P>
When taking logical decisions, your Amiga understands the following character symbols, which
are used as a form of short-hand:</P>

<PRE>
<b>Symbol  Meaning</b>
=       equal to
&lt;&gt;      not equal to
&gt;       greater than
&gt;       less than
&gt;=      greater than or equal to
&lt;=      less than or equal to
</PRE>

<P>There are also three functions that can be called during the decision making process.</P>
