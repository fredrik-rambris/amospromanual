<h1>Procedures</h1>

<br>

<P>
By pressing [Alt] and [Down Arrow] together, the edit cursor automatically jumps to the 
next procedure definition in your program. To jump to the previous procedure, press [Alt] and 
[Up Arrow] together. This shortcut works equally well with labels and line numbers!</P>

<P>If you are using several procedures on the same line, you can avoid the risk of a 
procedure being
confused with a label by adding an extra space at the end of each statement. For 
example:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; HEY: HEY: HEY: Rem Perform HEY procedure three times
   HEY: HEY: HEY: Rem Define label HEY and perform HEY procedure twice
</pre>

<P>
<b>PROC</b><BR>
<i>structure: flag a procedure</i><BR>
<b>Proc</b> NAME</P>

<P>Another way to identify a procedure is to precede it with a PROC statement. Run the 
following example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Rem Demonstrate that a procedure is being called not simply a command
   Proc HELLO
   Rem The same can be achieved without the Proc
   HELLO
   Procedure HELLO
    Print "Hey!"
   End Proc
</pre>

<P>It is possible to place the procedure definition anywhere in your program. When AMOS
Professional encounters a procedure statement, the procedure is recognised and a jump is 
made to the final End Proc. In this way, there is no risk of executing your procedure by 
accident.</P>


<P><b>Opening and closing procedures</b><br>

If a great many procedures are used, your listings may appear cluttered and confused by 
all of their definitions. Because of this problem, there is a simple method of "closing" a 
procedure. Self-contained procedures can be neatly hidden away inside your main program if you need 
to reduce the size and complexity of your listings.</P>

<P>Type in the following procedure on your editing screen:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; MAIN_TITLE
   Procedure MAIN TITLE
    Curs Off
    Centre "Main Title"
    Say "Amos Professional presents."
    Fade 5
   End Proc
</pre>

<P>Run that if you like, and then return to the Edit screen.</P>
