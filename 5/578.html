<p><b>Reserving a bank</b><br>

It has already been explained that AMOS Professional allocates certain types of bank
automatically. To create any other required memory bank, they must first be "reserved". The
RESERVE AS command is followed by the type of bank that you want to create, a comma, then
the number of bytes needed for the length of this bank.</p>

<p>If a selected bank already exists, it will be erased to make room for the new definition.</p>

<p>
Allowable <b>bank numbers</b> range from 1 to 65535, but because bank numbers 1 to 4 are already
used internally by the AMOS Professional system, new banks should be reserved using the bank
numbers 5 and above. For users who have upgraded from earlier versions of the AMOS system,
you will have noted the increase in the range of available bank numbers from the original 15.
There are four alternative types of bank that can be reserved, and these will now be explained.</p>

<p>
<b>RESERVE AS DATA</b><br>
<i>instruction: reserve a new data bank</i><br>
<b>Reserve As Data</b> bank number,length</p>

<p>
This reserves the selected bank number with the number of bytes specified as its length. Data
banks are <b>permanent</b>, and wherever possible, their memory will be allocated from fast memory,
so this type of bank should <b>not</b> be used for information such as Objects and samples which need
to be accessed directly by the Amiga's hardware chips.</p>

<p>
<b>RESERVE AS WORK</b><br>
<i>instruction: reserve a new work bank</i><br>
<b>Reserve as Work</b> bank number,length</p>

<p>This allocates a <b>temporary</b> workspace of the requested length from fast memory, if it is available.</p>
