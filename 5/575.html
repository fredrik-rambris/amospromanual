<h1>the Joystick and Mouse</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Limiting the mouse pointer</b><br>

One of the commonest screen conventions for both leisure and serious programs is the use of
control panels. AMOS Professional relies on them extensively for ease of use and clarity.
Supposing you need to set up a control panel on your screen, but you want to prevent the
mouse pointer from wandering outside the area of that panel.</p>

<p>
<b>LIMIT MOUSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: limit mouse pointer to part of the screen</i><br>
<b>Limit Mouse</b> x1 ,y1 To x2,y2<br>
<b>Limit Mouse</b></p>

<p>
This command sets up a rectangular area for the mouse pointer to move around, and traps it
inside the boundaries ,set by hardware coordinates, from the rectangle's top-left TO bottom
right-hand corner. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Limit Mouse 300,100 To 350,150
</pre>

<p>
If you need to restore freedom to the mouse pointer and allow it to move around the entire
screen, use the LIMIT MOUSE instruction on its own, without any coordinates after it. Note that
SCREEN OPEN must be followed by a WAIT VBL command before LIMIT MOUSE can be used,
otherwise no screen will be set up for screen limits to be set.</p>

<p><b>Finding the mouse pointer</b><br>

If you already understand the concept of different screens and screen zone numbers, you will
appreciate that it is not difficult to lose track of the mouse pointer.</p>

<p>
You may need to keep a check on various screens and screen zones in order to keep in control of
the mouse pointer. If you do not already understand the concept of different screens and screen
zone numbers, you will need to become familiar with the various SCREEN commands and
ZONE functions.</p>

<p>
<b>MOUSE ZONE</b><br>
<i>function: check if the mouse pointer is in a zone</i><br>
zone number=<b>Mouse Zone</b></p><br>

<p>
The MOUSE ZONE function checks to see where the mouse pointer is currently located, and if
it has entered a screen zone, the number of that zone is returned. It is equivalent to the
following line:</p>

<pre>
X> X=Hzone(X Mouse,Y Mouse)
</pre>

<p>
<b>MOUSE SCREEN</b><br>
<i>function: check which screen the mouse pointer is occupying</i><br>
screen number=<b>Mouse Screen</b></p>
