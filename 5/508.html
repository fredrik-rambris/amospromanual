<br>

<P><b>STOP</b><BR>
<i>instruction: interrupt the current program</i><BR>
<b>Stop</b></P>

<P>To stop the current program. The <b>STOP</b> instruction is used like this:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Print "Interrupt in two seconds!"
   Wait 100
   Stop
   Print "I have been abandoned"
</pre>

<P><b>EDIT</b><BR>
<i>instruction: leave current program and return to Edit Screen</i><BR>
<b>Edit</b></P>

<P>Similarly, the EDIT instruction forces the program to be abandoned, and returns you 
straight to the Edit Screen, like this:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Print "Wait four seconds and then EDIT"
   Wait 200
   Edit
   Print "I have been ignored!"
</pre>

<P><b>DIRECT</b><BR>
<i>instruction: leave current program and return to Direct Mode</i><BR>
<b>Direct</b></P>

<P>Use the DIRECT command to jump out of the current program and go straight to Direct 
Mode for testing out a programming idea.</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Print "Take me to Direct Mode immediately"
   Direct
</pre>

<P>Normally, a program can be interrupted by pressing the [Ctrl] and the [C] keys together,
returning you to the AMOS Professional Edit Screen. This facility can be turned off and on 
at will, creating a crude sort of program protection.</P>

<P><b>BREAK OFF</b><BR>
<b>BREAK ON</b><BR>
<i>instructions: toggle the program break keys off and on</i><BR>
<b>Break Off</b><BR>
<b>Break On</b></P>

<P>The BREAK OFF command can be included in a program to stop a particular routine from being
interrupted while it is running. To re-start the interrupt feature, use BREAK ON. But be <b>warned!</b></P>
