<h1>Control Structures</h1>

<br>

<P><b>Forced jumps</b><br>
So far, it has been explained how certain jumps are made to another part of a program by logical
decisions based on whether a situation is true or false. Similar jumps can be made whenever a
particular variable is recognised, in other words, regardless of any other conditions. GOTO and
GOSUB are examples of a "forced" jump.</P>

<P>
<b>ON</b><BR>
<i>structure: jump on recognising a variable</i><BR>
<b>On</b> variable <b>Proc</b> list of procedures<BR>
<b>On</b> variable <b>Goto</b> list of numbered lines or labels<BR>
<b>On</b> variable <b>Gosub</b> list of numbered lines or labels</p>


<P>
ON can be used to force the program to jump to a pre-defined position when it 
recognises a specified variable. Furthermore, jumps can be made to a choice of several positions, 
depending on what value is held by the variable at the time it is spotted. ON can force a jump to 
any of the following structures.</P>

<P><b>Procedures</b>. When using an ON ... PROC structure, one or more named procedures is used 
as the target destination for a jump, depending on the contents currently held by a variable. 
Look at the following line:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; On X Proc PROCEDURE1,PROCEDURE2
</pre>

<P>That is exactly the same as saying:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; If X=1 Then PROCEDURE1
   If X=2 Then PROCEDURE2
</pre>

<P>
It is important to note that procedures used in this way cannot include any parameters. 
If information is to be transferred to the procedure, it should be placed in a <b>global</b> 
variable, as explained in <a href="542.html">Chapter 5.5</a>.</P>

<P><b>Goto</b> is used to jump to one of a list of numbered lines, or a label, depending on the 
result of an expression. For example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Print "Type in a value from 1 to 3"
   Input X
   On X Goto LABEL1,LABEL2,LABEL3
   LABEL1:
   Print "Ready"
   LABEL2:
   Print "Steady"
   LABEL3:
   Print "Go!"
</pre>
