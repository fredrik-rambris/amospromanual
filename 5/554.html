<h1>Text</h1>

<br>

<p>The first value selects one of five writing modes:</p>

<pre>
<b>Value   Mode        Effect</b>
0       REPLACE     New text replaces any existing screen data  
1       OR          Merge new text with screen data, using logical OR
2       XOR         Combine new text with screen data, using OR
3       AND         Combine new text and screen data, using logical AND
4       IGNORE      Ignore all subsequent printing instructions
</pre>

<p>A number set as the optional second value selects which parts of the text are to be printed on the
screen, as follows:</p>


<pre>
<b>Value Mode   Effect</b>
0     Normal Print text and background together
1     Paper  Only the background to be drawn on screen
2     Pen    Ignore paper colour and print text on background colour zero
</pre>

<p>The default value for both of the WRITING parameters is zero, giving normal printed output.</p>

<p><b>Positioning the text cursor</b><br>
	
Characters are always printed at the current position of the text cursor, and the AMOS
Professional programmer is offered several methods of controlling the cursor in order to make
text look more orderly, attractive or eye-catching.</p>

<p>
<b>LOCATE</b><br>
<i>instruction: position the text cursor</i><br>
<b>Locate</b> x,<br>
<b>Locate</b> ,y<br>
<b>Locate</b> x,y</p>

<p>This command moves the text cursor to the coordinates of your choice, and this new location
sets the start position for all subsequent text printing until you command otherwise. All screen
positions are measured in "text coordinates", which are measured in units of one printed
character on screen, with the x-coordinate controlling the horizontal position and the y-
coordinate referring to the vertical. So, the top left-hand corner of the screen has coordinates of
0,0 whereas text coordinates of 15,10 refer to a position 15 characters from the left-hand edge of
the screen and 10 characters from the top.</p>

<p>The range of these coordinates will depend on the size of your character set and the dimensions
of the display area allocated, known as a "window". All coordinate measurements are taken
using text coordinates relative to the current window. If you try and print something outside of
these limits, an error will be generated. Windows are dealt with in the next Section, but the
current screen is automatically treated as a window, so there is no need to "open" one to test the
following examples:</p>

<pre>
E> Print "0,0": Locate 10, : Print "Stay on current line"
   Locate ,5 : Print "Six from the top."
   Locate 10,10 : Print "Ten down and ten across"
</pre>
