<h1>Procedures</h1>

<br>

<P>
Make sure that the edit cursor is over the procedure statement, select the [Procedures] 
option rom the [Editor] menu and trigger the [Open/Close] option, or hit [F9] as a short-cut. The
procedure definition is neatly folded away from view, and in normal practice you would be
allowed to concentrate on your main program without the distraction of chunks of 
procedures getting in the way. In other words, you can achieve greater programming clarity in your 
listings by closing procedures from view. The last example should now look like this:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; MAIN TITLE
   Procedure MAIN_TITLE
</pre>

<P>To reveal the procedure at any time, simply move the cursor back to the procedure line 
and reveal its definitions with [F9] or [Open/Close].</P>

<P>Closed procedures can be executed as normal, and saved or loaded along with an AMOS
Professional program listing. But a closed procedure cannot be deleted using the program
cursor, and a deletion can only be made if the procedure is opened again or by means of 
the [Cut] option.</P>

<P>
To open and close all of the procedures in the current program, the [Open All] and 
[Close All] options are provided. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard short-cuts [Amiga]+[Shift]
+[0] and [Amiga]+[Shift]+[C], as already explained under the full list of Editor options in
<a href="../4/401.html">Chapter 4.1</a>.</P>

<P><b>Jumping in and out of a procedure</b><br>

You should be familiar with the use of ON for jumping to a GOSUB routine. It is just as 
simple to use this structure with procedures.<BR>

<p>
<b>ON ... PROC</b><BR>
<i>structure: trigger a jump to a procedure</i><BR>
<b>On</b> variable value <b>Proc</b> NAME</P>

<P>In this case, if a variable holds a particular value, a system is automatically 
triggered that forces a
jump to a named procedure. Of course you can have as many values triggering off as many
jumps to different procedures as you want. For example:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; On X Proc PROCEDURE1,PROCEDURE2
</pre>

<P>Which is exactly the same as saying:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; If X=1 Then PROCEDURE1
X&gt; If X=2 Then PROCEDURE2
</pre>

<P>Normally, procedures will only return to the main program when the END PROC instruction 
is reached. But supposing you need to jump out of a procedure instantly.</P>

<P>
<b>POP PROC</b><BR>
<i>structure: leave a procedure immediately</i><BR>
<b>Pop Proc</b></P>
