<h1>the Bare Bones</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Marking the bones of a program</b><BR>

Imagine that the skeleton of your latest programming masterpiece is so clever and so 
complex that you cannot remember where everything is or what anything is supposed to do! There is 
a simple and effective way of marking any part of an AMOS Professional program, by inserting
typed messages to remind yourself exactly what this section of program is for. These 
little comments or messages are known as "Rem statements".</P>

<P><b>REM</b><BR>
<i>structure: insert a reminder message into a program</i><BR>
<b>Rem</b> Typed in statement<BR>
<b>'</b> Typed in statement</P>

<P>
The beginning of a Rem statement is marked by REM or by the apostrophe character, which 
is simply a short-cut recognised by AMOS Professional as a REM. The message or comment is 
then typed in from the keyboard, beginning with a capital letter. Here are some examples:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; 'An apostrophe can be used instead of the characters Rem
   Rem The next line will print a greeting
   Print "a greeting"
   'This line is a comment that does nothing at all
   Wait 75: Rem Wait one and a half seconds
   'Return to the Edit Screen
   Edit
</pre>

<P>These reminders are for human intelligence only, and when a Rem statement is 
encountered in a program, it is completely ignored by the computer.</P>

<P>
Rem statements can occupy their own line, or be placed at the end of a line of the 
program, as long as they are separated from the last instruction by a colon. But the apostrophe 
character can only be used to mark a Rem statement at the <b>beginning</b> of a line. The first of the next two 
lines is fine, but the second will create an error:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; Print "This example is fine" : Rem Fine example
   Print "Wrong!" : ' This is illegal
