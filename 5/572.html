<h1>the Joystick and Mouse</h1>

<br>

<pre>
<b>Number Shape of mouse cursor</b>
1      Arrow pointer (default shape)
2      Cross-hair
3      Clock
</pre>

<p>
<b>CHANGE MOUSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: change the shape of the mouse pointer</i><br>
<b>Change Mouse</b> number</p>

<p>
To change the shape of the pointer arrow, use this command followed by the number of the
required shape listed above. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Do
    For N=1 To 3
     Change Mouse N
     Wait 25
   Next N
  Loop
</pre>

<p>There is no need to restrict your choice to these three shapes. If you select an image number
greater than three, AMOS Professional will look at an image stored in the sprite bank, and install
it as the mouse pointer. The first image in the bank may be called up by using Change Mouse 4,
the second by specifying number 5, and so on. To make use of this option, sprites can feature no
more than four colours, and they must be exactly 16 pixels wide, although any height is allowed.
For such oversized sprites, the SET SPRITE BUFFER command should be used, which is
explained in <a href="../7/701.html">Chapter 7.1</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>HIDE</b><br>
<i>instruction: remove the mouse pointer from the screen</i><br>
<b>Hide</b><br>
<b>Hide</b> On</p>

<p>This instruction hides the mouse pointer by making it invisible. Although it cannot be seen, it is
still active and sending back reports, and the position of the mouse pointer co-ordinates can still
be read. AMOS Professional will automatically count the number of times that the HIDE
instruction is used, and employ this number to SHOW the mouse pointer once again at your
command. If you prefer to keep the mouse pointer invisible all the time and ignore the counting
system, use the special ON version of the instruction, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Hide On
</pre>

<p>
<b>SHOW</b><br>
<i>instruction: reveal the mouse pointer back on screen</i><br>
<b>Show</b><br>
<b>Show</b> On</p>

<p>This makes the mouse pointer visible again after a HIDE instruction.</p>
