<h1>the Joystick and Mouse</h1>

<br>

<p>
Use MOUSE SCREEN to return the number of the screen where the mouse pointer is currently
located, like this:</p>

<pre>
E> X=Mouse Screen
   Print X
</pre>

<p><b>Displaying menus with the mouse pointer</b><br>

Finally, as an AMOS Professional programmer, you will want to make use of the automatic
facility for displaying all the menus whose root starts from the current position of the mouse
pointer.</p>

<p>
<b>MENU MOUSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: display menu under current mouse pointer location</i><br>
<b>Menu Mouse On</b><br>
<b>Menu Mouse Off</b></p>

<p>
When this facility is turned ON, any menus that have been set up at the current location of the
mouse pointer are instantly displayed on screen. The mouse coordinates are added to the
MENU BASE in order to calculate the position where the menus are displayed, so you are able
to place a menu at a pre-set distance away from the mouse pointer if you like. To stop this
automatic process, simply use MENU MOUSE OFF.</p>

<p>
Please see <a href="../6/638.html">Chapter 6.5</a> which deals with all aspects of AMOS Professional menus, if you are not
experienced in their use.</p>
