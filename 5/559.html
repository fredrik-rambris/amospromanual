<h1>Text</h1>

<br>

<p>The MEMORIZE commands store the current position of the x or y text cursor, so that you can
print any text on the screen without destroying the original cursor coordinates. These may be
reloaded using the REMEMBER commands, as follows:</p>

<p>
<b>REMEMBER X/Y</b><br>
<i>instructions: restore the x or y text cursor coordinates</i><br>
<b>Remember X</b><br>
<b>Remember Y</b></p>

<p>Use REMEMBER to position the text cursor at the coordinates saved by a previous MEMORIZE
command. If MEMORIZE has not been used, the relevant coordinate will automatically be set to
zero. There is a ready-made example demonstrating these commands to be found under the SET
CURS command, which is below.</p>

<p><b>Changing the text cursor</b></p>

<p>
<b>CURS PEN</b><br>
<i>instruction: select colour of text cursor</i><br>
<b>Curs Pen</b> index number</p>

<p>As a default, whenever your screen mode provides four or more colours the text cursor is set to
index number 3, which is endowed with a built-in flash. The flashing can be turned off and back
on again at any time using the FLASH OFF and FLASH commands, but as soon as you select
another colour for your text cursor, the automatic flash will not apply. To change colours, use
the CURS PEN command, followed by the index number of your choice. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Curs Pen 2
</pre>

<p>Note that the new colour only effects the text cursor in the current open window, and has no
influence over other cursors used by any other windows. If you want to introduce a flash to that
last example, you could add this line before the CURS PEN command:</p>

<pre>
X> Flash 2,"(FFF,15)(000,15)"
</pre>

<p>
<b>SET CURS</b><br>
<i>instruction: set the shape of the text cursor</i><br>
<b>Set Curs</b> L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6,L7,L8</p>

<p>To customise the text cursor into something a little more personalised, you can change its shape
into anything you like, providing you limit yourself to the eight lines of eight bits each that
represent its appearance. Lines are numbered one to eight from top to bottom, and every bit set
to 1 results in a pixel drawn in the current cursor pen colour, whereas a zero displays the current
paper colour. To familiarise yourself with the technique, try the next example, which changes
the text cursor into a Hallowe'en mask:</p>
