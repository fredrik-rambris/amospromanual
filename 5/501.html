<h1>the Bare Bones</h1>

<br>

<P>
Ths Chapter provides you with the bare bones that support AMOS Professional 
programming. These bones are used to build program skeletons, and you need to understand what they do
and how they work before adding the life-blood, the muscle-power and the brain-control 
that endow a program with its own life.</P>

<P>
If you are an experienced programmer, you will already be familiar with these bare 
bones, and you can safely skip through most of this Chapter.</P>

<P>
AMOS Professional is designed to provide you with the easiest and most convenient way 
of controlling all your programming needs, and even though it provides very powerful
programming features, difficult concepts and terms are avoided wherever possible.
This section begins with one of the simplest concepts in computing, known as 
"strings".</P>

<p><b>Strings</b><br>

A "string" is a number of characters strung together. A set of quotation marks is 
placed at either end of the string to hold it together and keep it separate from the rest of the program. 
Each string is also identified by its own name, so that it can be called up by that name, and 
used elsewhere in the program. The "dollar" character $ is attached to the end of every string 
name, to mark the fact that this name refers to a string. On UK Keyboards, quote marks are typed 
in by pressing the [Shift] and [2] keys together, and the $ character is typed with [Shift] plus [4].</P>

<P>
Characters in a string can be letters, numbers, symbols or spaces. The following 
example creates a simple string named A$, and it is defined by letting the name of the string equal the 
characters enclosed in quotes, like this:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; "AMOS Professional"
   Print A$
</pre>

<P>Here is another example, using three different strings:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; A$="AMOS"
   B$=""
   C$="Professional"
   Print A$+B$+C$
</pre>

<P>Strings are extremely useful, and they can act on their own or work together, as that 
last example demonstrated. Try the next example now:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; A$="AMOS PROFESSIONAL"-"S"
   Print A$
</pre>

<P>The whole of <a href="511.html">Chapter 5.2</a> is devoted to how AMOS Professional makes use of strings.</P>

<P><b>Variables</b><BR>
	
There are certain elements of a computer program that are set aside to store the results 
of calculations. The names of these storage locations are known as "variables".</P>
