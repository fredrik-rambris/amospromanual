<h1>the Bare Bones</h1>

<br>

<P>
To introduce a name, or split it up, use the "underscore" character instead of spaces, by 
typing [Shift] and [-] together. For example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; _IAM A_LONG_LEGAL_VARIABLE_NAME=1
   Print _IAM A_LONG_LEGAL_VARIABLE_NAME
</pre>

<p><b>Types of variables</b><br>

There are three types of variable that can be used in AMOS Professional programs.</P>

<P><b>Whole Numbers</b><br>

The first of these types is where the variable represents a whole number, like 1 or 
9999. These variables are perfect for holding the sort of values used in computer games, for example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; HI SCORE=1000000
   Print HI SCORE</P>
</pre>

<P>
Whole numbers are called "integers", and integer variables can range from -147,483,648 
up to 147,483,648.</P>

<P><b>Real number variables</b><br>

Variables can also represent fractional values, such as 1.2 or 99.99 and the results 
from this sort of variable can be extremely accurate. The accuracy of numbers either side of a decimal 
point (known as "floating point" numbers) is fully explained in <a href="518.html">Chapter 5.3</a>.</P>

<P>Real number variables must always have a "hash" symbol added to the end of their names,
which is typed by pressing the tit] key. For example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; REAL_NUMBER#=3.14
   Print REAL_NUMBER#
</pre>

<P><b>String variables</b><br>

This type of variable holds text characters, and the length of the text can be anything 
from zero up to 65,500 characters long. String variables are enclosed in quotation marks, and are 
also distinguished from number variables by a $ character on the end of their names, to tell 
AMOS Professional that they will contain text rather than numbers. For example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; NAME$="Name"
   GUITAR$="Twang"
   Print NAME$,GUITAR$
</pre>

<P><b>Storing variables</b><br>

All variables are stored in an 8k memory area called a "buffer". This area can hold 
about 2000 numbers or two pages of normal text, and it has been set as small as possible to allow 
more space for memory banks and screens of graphics. When there is not enough room left to 
store all of the variables in a program, an error message will appear saying "Out of variable 
space". The size of the storage space for variables can be increased at any time, and the only limit 
to the size of arrays and string variables is the amount of memory available in your computer.</P>
