<h1>Text</h1>

<br>

<p>To underline text when printed on screen like this, use the UNDER instructions, as follows:</p>

<pre>
E> Under On : Print "This is where we draw the line"
   Under Off: "That is groundless"
</pre>

<p>In <a href="../11/1101.html">Section 11.1</a> there is a full explanation of how to take advantage of any number of different
type faces or fonts, by making use of what is known as "graphic text". For the time being, try the
next example:</p>

<pre>
E> Cls: For S=0 To 7: Set Text S
   Text 100,S*20+20,AMOS Professional" : Next S
</pre>

<p>
<b>SET TEXT</b><br>
<i>instruction: set the style of a text font</i><br>
<b>Set Text</b> style number</p>

<p>The SET TEXT command allows you to change the style of a font by selecting one of eight
different styles that are produced by mixing the following three elements</p>

<pre>
Bit 0 <u>Underline</u>
Bit 1 <b>Bold</b>
Bit 2 <i>Italic</i>
</pre>


<p>Set the appropriate bits in the form of a style number from 0 to 7, as in the last example.</p>

<p>
<b>TEXT STYLES</b><br>
<i>function: return current text style</i><br>
s=<b>Text Styles</b></p>

<p>This function returns the index reference of the text style you last selected using SET TEXT. The
result is a bit-map in the same format as explained above:</p>

<pre>
Set Text 2: Print "Style Two"
Print Text Styles
</pre>

<p><b>Changing the text mode</b><br>

For even more flexibility in presenting your text on screen, you can select the way it is combined
with other screen data.</p>

<p>
<b>WRITING</b><br>
<i>instruction: select text writing mode of subsequent text</i><br>
<b>Writing</b> value1<br>
<b>Writing</b> value1,optional value2</p>

<p>The WRITING command is used to control how the subsequent text interacts with what is
already on the screen, and it can be followed by either one or two values.</p>
