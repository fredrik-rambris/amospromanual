<h1>the Joystick and Mouse</h1>

<br>

<pre>
E> For N=150 To 300
    X Mouse=N : Y Mouse=N/2
    Print X Mouse : Print Y Mouse
   Next N
</pre>

<p>
<b>MOUSE KEY</b><br>
<i>function: read status of mouse buttons</i><br>
k=<b>Mouse Key</b></p>

<p>
The MOUSE KEY function checks whether one of the mouse buttons has been pressed and
makes a report in the form of a binary pattern made up of these elements:</p>

<pre>
<b>Pattern      Report</b>
Bit 0        Left mouse button
Bit 1        Right mouse button
Bit 2        Third mouse button if it exists
</pre>

<p>
As usual, the numbers zero and one make up the report, with a one displayed when the
relevant button is held down, otherwise a zero is shown. Try this routine:</p>

<pre>
E> Curs Off
   Do
    Locate 0,0
    M= Mouse Key : Print "Bit Pattern ";Bin$(M,8);" Number ";M
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
<b>MOUSE CLICK</b><br>
<i>function: check for click of mouse button</i><br>
c=<b>Mouse Click</b></p>

<p>
This is similar to MOUSE KEY, but instead of checking to see whether or not a mouse button is
held down, MOUSE CLICK is only interested in whether the user has just made a single click on
a mouse button. It returns the familiar bit pattern of these elements:</p>


<pre>
<b>Pattern    Report</b>
Bit 1      Single test for left mouse button
Bit 2      Single test for right mouse button
Bit 3      Single test for third mouse button, if available
</pre>

<p>
These bits are automatically re-set to zero after one test has been made, so they will only check
for a single key press at a time. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Curs Off
   Do
    M=Mouse Click
    If M<>0 Then Print "Bit Pattern ";Bin$(M,8);" Number";M
   Loop
</pre>
