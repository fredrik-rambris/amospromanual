<h1>the Bare Bones</h1>

<br>

<P>
AMOS Professional provides over 200 ready-made functions, but it allows you to create as many
different functions as you like! These "user-defined" functions are set up inside your own
programs, and they can be used to compute commonly used values very quickly and very
simply.</P>

<P><b>DEF FN</b><BR>
<i>structure: create a user-defined function</i><BR>
<b>Def Fn</b> name (list of variables)=expression</P>
	
<P>
To create a user-defined function, give it a name and follow the name with a list of variables.
These variables must be held inside a pair of round brackets, and separated from one another by
commas, like these examples:</P>

<PRE>
X&gt; Def Fn NAME$(A$)=LOWER$(A$)
   Def Fn X(A,B,C)=A*B*C
</PRE>

<p>
When a user-defined function is called up my variables that are entered with it will be
substituted in the appropriate positions, as demonstrated below.</p>

<p><b>FN</b><BR>
<i>structure: call a user-defined function</i><BR>
<b>Fn</b> name(list of variables)</p>
	
<p>The following examples show how DEF FN is first used to define a function, and how FN 
calls it up:</p>

<pre>
E&gt; Def Fn NAME$(A$,X,Y)=Mid$(A$,X,Y)
   Print Fn NAME$("Professional",4,3)
  
E&gt; Def Fn X(A,B,C)=A+B+C
   Print Fn X(1,10,100)
</pre>

<P>
The expression that equals the user-defined function can include any of the standard 
AMOS Professional functions, and it is limited to a single line of a program.</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b><br>
The values that are entered into an AMOS Professional instruction are known as 
"parameters". If there is more than one parameter, each parameter must be separated from its neighbour 
by a comma.</P>

<P>
For example, up to three parameters can be used after an INK command, in the form of 
various numbers which specify which colour is to be used for drawing operations, then the 
background colour, and the third parameter setting a border colour. So an INK command could appear 
like this, with its three parameters ready to draw a shape:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Ink 0,1,2
   Bar 10,10 To 100,50
</pre>
