<h1>Control Structures</h1>

<br>

<P>There is a traditional group of instructions that allow computer programs to make 
decisions. They are usually known as control structures. This Chapter explains how AMOS Professional
takes (lie best of these traditions and uses them to give your Amiga a logical brain.</P>

<P>
<b>GOTO</b><BR>
<i>structure: jump to a specified place in the program</i><BR>
<b>Goto</b> label<BR>
<b>Goto</b> line number<BR>
<b>Goto</b> expression</P>

<P>
A computer program that can only obey a list of instructions one after the other is a 
very limited computer program indeed. One way of forcing programs to jump to specified locations is to 
use the old fashioned GOTO structure, followed by a target destination. In AMOS Professional,
these destinations can be a label, a line number or a variable. These are explained in 
<a href="501.html">Chapter 5.1</a>.</P>

<P>
<b>label</b> markers can consist of names that use any string of letters or numbers, as -well 
as the underscore character "_", and they must be ended with the colon character ":" as follows:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Print "Jump in two seconds" : Wait 100
   Goto LABEL_MARKER
   Wait 180000 : Rem Wait one hour
   LABEL_MARKER:
   Print "Now is the time to jump!"
</pre>

<P>
<b>Numbers</b> may be used to identify specific lines, and the program can be commanded to 
GOTO one of these optional markers, like this:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Goto 5
   Print "I am being ignored"
   5 Print "I am line 5"
</pre>

<P>
It should be obvious that these identification numbers have nothing to do with the 
number of lines in a program, but they may still lead to confusion. Labels are much easier to 
remember and to locate.</P>

<P>
<b>Expressions</b> can also be used for this purpose, and the expression may be any string or 
integer. Strings hold the name of a label, and integers return a line identification number. Here 
is an example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; BEGIN:
   Goto "BED"+"2"
   End
   BED1:
   Print "This Bed will never be used"
   Bed2:
   Print "Welcome to Bed Two!"
   Wait 20
   Goto BEGIN
</pre>
