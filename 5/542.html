<h1>Procedures</h1>

<br>

<P>
A procedure is a component of a computer program that allows the AMOS Professional
programmer to tackle one aspect of the program at a time, without becoming distracted or 
side-tracked by other programming considerations. Procedures can be thought of as programming
modules, each with a specific purpose and sphere of operation. This Chapter explains how
procedures are created and fully exploited.</P>

<P><b>Creating a procedure</b></p>

<p>
<b>PROCEDURE</b><BR>
<i>structure: create a procedure</i><BR>
<b>Procedure</b> NAME [list of optional parameters]</P>

<P>
<b>END PROC</b><BR>
<i>structure: end a procedure</i><BR>
<b>End Proc</b></p>

<p>
A procedure is created in exactly the same way as a normal variable, by giving it a name. 
The name is then followed by a list of parameters and the procedure must be ended with an END
PROC command. PROCEDURE and END PROC commands must be placed on their own
individual lines. For example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Procedure HELLO
   Print "Hello, I am a procedure!"
   End Proc
</pre>

<P>
If you try and run that program, nothing will happen. This is because a procedure must 
be called up by name from inside your program before it can do anything. Now add the 
following line at the start of that last example, and then [Run] it.</P>

<pre>
E&gt; HELLO
</pre>

<P>There is nothing preventing a procedure from calling itself, but this recursion is 
limited by the
area of storage allocated for local variables. If this local variable space is full, it 
can be increased
using the SET BUFFER command. Programs can also be held up if there is no more stack space
available, and this problem is cured by the following command.</P>

<P>
<b>SET STACK</b><BR>
<i>instruction: set stack space</i><BR>
<b>Set Stack</b> number</P>

<P>When AMOS Professional procedures call themselves, an "Out of stack space" error 
message will be generated after about fifty loops. Use the SET STACK instruction by specifying the 
new number of procedure calls that an be made.</P>

<P><b>Keeping track of procedures</b><br>

To help you find the starting positions of procedures in a very long program, there is 
a simple short-cut that uses just two keys.</P>
