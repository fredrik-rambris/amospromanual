<h1>Windows</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Manipulating windows</b></p>

<p>
<b>WINDON</b><br>
<i>function: return the value of the current window</i><br>
w=<b>Windon</b></p>

<p>Before using windows in your programs, you will need to refer to their identification numbers.
This function returns the value of the current window. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Do
    Cls : Wind Open Rnd(99)+1,1,1,25,5,1
    Print "Window number ";Windon : Wait Key
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
<b>WIND SAVE</b><br>
<i>instruction: save the contents of the current window</i><br>
<b>Wind Save</b></p>

<p>
This command is extremely valuable for the AMOS Professional programmer. Once activated,
the WIND SAVE feature allows you to move your windows anywhere on screen without
corrupting the existing display, by the following method. The contents of the current window is
saved as soon as the command is used, and then every time a new window is opened, the
contents of the windows underneath get saved automatically. The screen is then re-drawn
whenever a window is moved to a new position or closed.</p>

<p>
As you begin a new program, the current window (the default screen) consumes 32k of valuable
memory, and this would be wasted if you were to save it as background beneath a small
dialogue box. To solve this problem, create a dummy window of the size you need, and place it
over the zone you want to save. Now execute your WIND SAVE command and continue with
your program. When this dialogue box is called up, the area beneath it will be saved as part of
your dummy window, so it will automatically be restored after your box has been removed.</p>

<p>
<b>WIND CLOSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: close the current window</i><br>
<b>Wind Close</b></p>

<p>
The WIND CLOSE command deletes the current window. If the WIND SAVE command has
been activated, the deleted window will be replaced by the saved graphics, otherwise the area
will be totally erased from the screen. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Wind Open 1,1,8,35,18,1 : Print "Press a key to close this window"
   Wait Key
   Wind Close
</pre>

<p>
<b>WIND MOVE</b><br>
<i>instruction: move the current window</i><br>
<b>Wind Move</b> x,y</p>
