<h1>Control Structures</h1>

<br>

<P>
Unlike that last example, instead of checking if a condition is true or false at the start 
of a loop, the pair of commands makes its check at the end of a loop. REPEAT marks the start and 
UNTIL the end of the loop to be checked. This means that if a condition is false at the 
beginning of a</P>

<P>
WHILE ... WEND structure, that loop will never be performed at all, but if it is true 
at the beginning of a REPEAT ... UNTIL structure, the loop will be performed at least once. Here 
is an example that waits for you to press a mouse button:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Repeat
    Print "I can go on forever" : Wait 25
   Until Mouse Key&lt;&gt;0
</pre>

<P><b>Controlled loops</b><br>

When deciding how many times a loop is to be repeated, control can be made much more
definite than relying on whether conditions are true or false.</P>

<P>
<b>FOR</b><BR>
<b>TO</b><BR>
<b>NEXT</b><BR>
<i>structure: repeat loop a specific number of times</i><BR>
<b>For</b> index=first number <b>To</b> last number<BR>
list of statements<BR>
<b>Next</b> index</P>

<P>
This control structure is one of the programmer's classic devices. Each FOR statement 
must be matched by a single NEXT, and pairs of FOR ... NEXT loops can be nested inside one 
another. Each loop repeats a list of instructions for a specific number of times, governed by an 
index which counts the number of times the loop is repeated. Once inside the loop, this index 
can be read by the program as if it is a normal variable. Here is a simple example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; For X=1 To 7
    Print "SEVEN DEADLY SINS"
   Next X
</pre>
	
<P>
<b>STEP</b><BR>
<i>structure: control increment of index in a loop</i><BR>
<b>For</b> index=first number <b>To</b> last number <b>Step</b> size</P>

<P>Normally, the index counter is increased by 1 unit at every turn of a FOR ... NEXT 
loop. When the current value exceeds that of the last number specified, the loop is terminated. For 
example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; For DAY=1 To 365
    Print DAY
   Next DAY
</pre>

<P>STEP is used to change the size of increase in the index value, like this:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; For DAY=1 To 365 Step 7
    Print DAY
   Next DAY
</pre>
