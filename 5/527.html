<h1>Maths</h1>

<br>

<P>
The HSIN function calculates the hyperbolic sine of a given angle.</P>

<P>
<b>HCOS</b><BR>
<i>function: calculate hyperbolic cosine</i><BR>
h#=<b>Hcos</b>(angle)<BR>
h#=<b>Hcos</b>(angle#)</P>

<P>Use this function to find the hyperbolic cosine of an angle.</P>

<P>
<b>HTAN</b><BR>
<i>function: calculate hyperbolic tangent</i><BR>
h#=<b>Htan</b>(angle)<BR>
h#=<b>Htan</b>(angle#)</P>

<P> HTAN returns the hyperbolic tangent of the given angle.</p>

<p><b>Random numbers</b><BR>
	
The easiest way to introduce an element of chance or surprise into a program is to throw 
some numbered options into an electronic pot and allow AMOS Professional to pull one out at
random. After a number has been selected and used, it is thrown back into the pot once 
again. It then has the same chance as any other number offered for selection, when the next random
choice is made.</P>

<P>
<b>RND</b><BR>
<i>function: generate a random number</i><BR>
value=<b>Rnd</b>(number)</P>

<P>
The RND function generates integers at random, between zero and any number specified in
brackets. If your specified number is greater than zero, random numbers will be generated 
up to that maximum number. However, if you specify 0, then RND will return the last random value
it generated. This is useful for debugging programs. Here is an example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Do
    C=Rnd(15) : X=Rnd(320) : Y=Rnd(200)
    Ink C : Text X,Y,"AMOS Professional at RANDOM"
   Loop
</pre>

<P>
<b>RANDOMIZE</b><BR>
<i>instruction: set the seed for a random number</i><BR>
<b>Randomize</b> seed</P>

<P>
In practice, the numbers produced by the RND function are not genuinely random at all. 
They are computed by an internal mathematical formula, whose starting point is taken from a 
number known as a "seed". This seed is set to a standard value whenever AMOS Professional is 
loaded into your Amiga, and that means that the sequence of numbers generated by the RND function
will be exactly the same each time your program is run.</P>
