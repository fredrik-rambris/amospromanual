<h1>the Joystick and Mouse</h1>

<br>

<p>
As a default, the system counts the number of times that the HIDE command has been used,
then reveals the pointer on screen when the number of SHOWs equals the number of HIDEs. To
bypass this counting system and reveal the mouse pointer immediately, use SHOW ON.</p>

<pre>
E> Do
    For N=1 To 10
     Hide : Wait N : Show
    Next N
   Loop
</pre>

<p><b>Reading the status of the mouse</b><br>

Whether or not the mouse pointer is visible, the computer must know two things in order to
make any use of the mouse. It needs to recognise where the mouse pointer is as well as if any of
the mouse buttons have been pressed.</p>

<p>
<b>X MOUSE</b><br>
<i>reserved variable: report or set the x-co-ordinate of the mouse pointer</i><br>
<b>X Mouse</b><br>
x=<b>X Mouse</b></p>

<p>X MOUSE reports the current location of the x-coordinate of the mouse pointer. Because
movement is controlled by the mouse rather than by software, coordinates are given in
hardware notation, which is demonstrated by the following example:</p>

<pre>
E> Do
    Print X Mouse
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
This can also be used to set a new coordinate position for the mouse pointer and move it to a
specific position on the screen. This is done by assigning a value to X MOUSE as if it was a Basic
variable. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> For N=200 To 350
    X Mouse=N
    Print X Mouse
   Next N
</pre>

<p>
<b>Y MOUSE</b><br>
<i>reserved variable: report or set the y-coordinate of the mouse pointer</i><br>
<b>Y Mouse</b><br>
y=<b>Y Mouse</b></p>

<p>
Y MOUSE is used to give the y-coordinate of the mouse pointer in hardware co-ordinates, or to
reposition the mouse pointer on screen, and it is employed in exactly the same way as X
MOUSE.</p>
