<br>

<P><b>SET BUFFER</b><BR>
<i>instruction: set the size of the variable area</i><BR>
<b>Set Buffer</b> number of kilobytes</P>

<P>
The SET BUFFER command can be used inside a program to set the new size of the variable
area. Simply follow the command with the number of kilobytes required, and you are
recommended to increase this value by 5k at a time, until enough space has been reserved 
in the buffer area. It is important to note that the SET BUFFER command must be the very first
instruction in your program, apart from any REM messages.</P>

<P><b>Arrays</b><br>

It is often necessary to use a whole set of similar variables for something like a 
table of football results or a catalogue for a record collection. Any set of variables can be grouped 
together in what is known as an "array".</P>

<P>
Supposing you have 100 titles in your record collection, and you need to tell AMOS 
Professional the size of the table of variables needed for your array. There is a special command for 
setting up this dimension.</P>

<P><b>DIM</b><BR>
<i>instruction: dimension an array</i><BR>
<b>Dim</b> variable name(number,number,number...)</P>

<P>
The DIM command is used to dimension an array, and the variables in your record 
collection table could be set up with a first line like this:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Dim ARTIST$(99),TITLE$(99),YEAR(99),PRICE#(99)
</pre>

<P>
Each dimension in the table is held inside round brackets, and if there is more than 
one element
in a dimension each number must be separated from the next by a comma.</P>

<P>Element numbers in arrays always start from zero, so your first and last entries might 
contain these variables:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; ARTIST$(0)="Aaron Copeland"
   TITLE$(0)="Appalachian Spring"
   YEAR(0)=1944
   PRICE#(0)=12.99
   ARTIST$(99)="ZZ Top"
   TITLE$(99)="Afterburner"
   YEAR(99)=1985
   PRICE#(99)=9.95
</pre>

<P>To extract elements from your array, you could then add something like this to your 
example program:</P>

<div align="right"> <a href="503.html">Back</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <a href="505.html">Next</a>
  <br>
  05.01.04
</div>
