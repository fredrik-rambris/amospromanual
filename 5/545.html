<h1>Procedures</h1>

<br>

<P>
The POP PROC instruction provides you with a fast getaway, if you ever find yourself in 
need of escape. Try this:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; ESCAPE
   Procedure ESCAPE
    For PRISON=1 To 1000000000
     If PRISON=10 Then Pop Proc
     Print "I am abandoned."
    Next PRISON
   End Proc
   Print "I'm free!"
</pre>

<P>
<b>ON BREAK PROC</b><BR>
<i>structure: jump to a procedure when break in program</i><BR>
<b>On Break Proc</b> NAME</P>

<P>A jump can also be made to a specified procedure when the program is interrupted. For
example:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; On Break Proc BROKEN
   Do
    Print "Unbroken" : Wait 50
   Loop
   Procedure BROKEN
    Print "I am the procedure"
   End Proc
</pre>

<P><b>Local and global variables</b><br>

All of the variables that are defined inside a procedure work completely separately 
from any other variables in your programs. We call these variables "local" to the procedure. All 
local variables are automatically discarded after the procedure has finished executing, so that 
in the following example the same value of 1 will always be printed, no matter how many times it 
is called:</P>

<pre>
X&gt; Procedure PLUS
    A=A+1 : Print A
   End Proc

</pre>

<P>
All the variables OUTSIDE of procedures are known as "global" variables, and they are 
not affected by any instructions inside a procedure. So it is perfectly possible to have the 
same variable name referring to different variables, depending on whether or not they are local 
or global.</P>

<P>When the next example is run, it can be seen that the values given to the global 
variables are different to those of the local variables, even though they have the same name.</P>
