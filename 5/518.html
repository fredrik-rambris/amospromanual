<h1>Maths</h1>

<br>

<P>This Chapter provides a full explanation of using standard mathematical and 
trigonometric functions, as well an insight into how AMOS Professional exploits numbers.</P>


<P><b>Arithmetical calculations</b><br>
Nothing could be simpler than asking AMOS Professional to run this sum:</P>

<pre>
D&gt; Print 2+2
</pre>
	
<P>Arithmetical operations are straightforward, provided the correct symbols are used, as follows:</P>


<P>+ the plus sign always signals addition</P>

<p>- the minus sign is used for subtraction</p>

<p>* for multiplication, an asterisk character must be used</p>
<p>/ divisions are made using the forward-slash symbol</p>
<p>^ the circumflex character is used as the exponential symbol, and it means "raise this
  number to a given power", which is exactly the same as multiplying a number with itself.</p>



<P>So the following two lines are interchangable:</P>

<pre>
D&gt; Print 3^5
   Print 3*3*3*3*3
</pre>

<P>The following logical operations can also be used in calculations:</P>


<P><b>MOD</b> is the "modulo" operator, which acts as a constant multiplier.
<b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b> and <b>XOR</b> are the three logical operations.</p>

<p><b>Calculation priorities</b><br>

Arithmetical instructions are taken literally, using a set of built-in priorities. So the 
following lines give the results 6 and 8 respectively:</P>

<pre>
D&gt; Print 2+2*2
   Print (2+2)*2
</pre>

<P>AMOS Professional handles a combination of calculations that make up an "expression" in 
the following strict order of priority:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>exponential numbers are always calculated first ( ^ ).</LI>

  <LI>multiplications and divisions are then calculated in order of appearance, from left 
  to right (*/). Remainders of divisions will be dealt with by any modulo operations (MOD).</LI>

  <LI>additions and subtractions are calculated last, again in order, from left to right 
  (+-).</LI>

  <LI>any logical operations will not be taken into account until after all the above 
  calculations have been completed (AND, OR, XOR).</LI>

</UL>

<P>Any calculation placed inside a pair of round brackets is evaluated first, and treated 
as a single number.</P>
