<h1>Maths</h1>

<br>

<P>
The INT function rounds <b>down</b> a floating point number to the nearest whole number (integer),
so that the result of the following two example lines is 3 and -2, respectively:</P>

<pre>
D&gt; Print Int(3.9999)
   Print Int(-1.1)
</pre>

<P><b>FIX</b><BR>
<i>instruction: fix precision of floating point</i><BR>
<b>Fix</b>(number)</P>

<P>The FIX command changes the way floating point numbers are displayed on screen, or 
output to a printer. The precision of these floating point numbers is determined by a number (n) 
that is specified in brackets, and there can be four possibilities, as follows:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>If (n) is greater than 0 and less than 16, the number of figures shown after the 
  decimal point will be n.</LI>

  <LI>If (n) equals 16 then the format is returned to normal.</LI>

  <LI>If (n) is greater than 16, any trailing zeros will be removed and the display will 
  be proportional.</LI>

  <LI>If (n) is less than 0, the absolute value ABS(n) will determine the number of digits 
  after the decimal point, and all floating point numbers will be displayed in exponential format.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Here are some examples:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Fix (2) : Print Pi# : Rem Two digits after decimal point
   Fix(-4) : Print Pi# : Rem Exponential with four digits after decimal point
   Fix(16) : Print Pi# : Rem Revert to normal mode
</pre>

<P><b>Single and double precision</b><br>

Although the standard floating point system is perfect for general use, it may not be 
accurate enough for genuine scientific applications, or advanced simulations. AMOS Professional 
offers a choice of two separate calculation systems.</P>

<P><b>Single Precision</b><br>

This is the default mode, and is automatically used whenever an AMOS Professional 
program is RUN. Single precision is accurate to about seven decimal digits, it is very fast 
and it is ideal for the vast majority of applications.</P>

<P><b>Double precision</b><BR>
	
Double precision mode offers double the normal degree of accuracy, and is capable of 
dealing with extremely precise values. Unlike most pocket calculators, AMOS Professional double
precision can handle numbers with up to 16 significant digits.</P>

<P>This extent of accuracy will consume twice as much memory as the standard version, and 
it will also cause a great slowing down of calculations. It should only be used when extra 
accuracy is absolutely vital.</P>
