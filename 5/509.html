<h1>the Bare Bones</h1>

<br>

<p>
Never run a program that is still being edited with BREAK OFF activated, or <b>you will lose 
your work</b>. Make a back-up copy first. Here are two examples, and if you insist on ignoring this
advice, you may be foolhardy enough to try the second one!</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Break Off
   Print "Try and press the Break keys now"
   Wait 500
   Break On
   Print "Break keys activated"
   Wait 100
   Direct

E&gt; Break Off
   Do
    Print "Get out of that!"
    Wait Key
   Loop

</pre>

<P><b>SYSTEM</b><BR>
<b>instruction: go to Workbench</b><BR>
<b>System</b></P>

<P>
To close AMOS Professional altogether, and go to the Workbench, the <b>System</b> command can 
be given from within a program, or from the Editor. The Direct Mode pre-set icon, is 
explained in <a href="../4/401.html">Chapter 4.1</a>, or simply press [Shift]+[F10].</P>

<pre>
D&gt; Print "Au revoir AMOS"
   System
</pre>

<P><b>Separating commands in a line</b><br>

So far in this Chapter, individual instructions have been separated from one another by 
typing them in and pressing the [Return] key to enter them on a new line of the program. In fact, 
the AMOS Professional programmer will often want to place groups of related commands together
on the same line of the program. This is achieved by separating your instructions with a 
colon character.</p>

<p>
AMOS Professional makes typing in instructions as simple as possible, and you will not
normally have to worry about typing in correct spacings, as long as you stick to the 
rules. When a colon is used to split up commands, command words are recognised and given a capital 
letter and a space automatically.</P>

<P>This can be proved by typing in the next example exactly as it appears below, and 
hitting the
Return] key:</P>

<pre>
E&gt; Print"I'm so":wait key:print"neat!"
