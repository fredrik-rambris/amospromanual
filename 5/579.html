<h1>Memory Banks</h1>

<br>

<p>The work data will be erased every time the program is run from the Editor, and it will be
discarded when the listing is saved onto disc. A quick check can be made to see if the data area
has been successfully assigned to fast memory, using the FAST FREE function, like this:</p>

<pre>
E> M=Fast Free : Rem Give the amount of available FAST memory
   Reserve As Work 10,1000
   If M<>Fast Free
     Print "The Data has been stored in FAST Ram"
   Else
     Print "Sorry, there is only CHIP Ram available"
   End If
</pre>

<p>
<b>RESERVE AS CHIP DATA</b><br>
<i>instruction: reserve a new chip data bank</i><br>
<b>Reserve As Chip Data</b> bank number,length</p>

<p>
Use this variation of the RESERVE AS instruction to allocate a <b>permanent</b> area of memory using
Chip Ram. If there is none available, an "Out of Memory" error will be reported. You can obtain
an instant read-out of the remaining chip memory by calling the CHIP FREE function, as
follows:</p>

<pre>
E> CF=Chip Free
   Print "Remaining Chip memory = ";CF;" bytes."
</pre>

<p>Once a bank has been defined by this command, it will be saved automatically, along with your
AMOS Professional Basic program.</p>

<p>
<b>RESERVE AS CHIP WORK</b><br>
<i>instruction: reserve a new chip work bank</i><br>
<b>Reserve As Chip Work</b> bank number,length</p>

<p>
This command allocates the selected block of <b>temporary</b> memory using Chip Ram, and it is often
used with the DOUBLE BUFFERED sampling system, to play samples directly from hard disc.
Here are some typical examples of the different RESERVE AS commands:</p>

<pre>
X> Reserve As Chip Work 10,10000: Rem 10000 bytes of chip workspace to bank 10
   Reserve As Work 11,5000: Rem 5000 bytes of fast workspace to bank 11
   Reserve As Chip Data 12,2000 : Rem 2000 bytes of permanent chip data to bank 12
   Reserve as Data 13,1000 : Rem 1000 bytes of fast data to bank 13
</pre>

<p><b>Saving memory banks</b><br>

AMOS Professional provides the simplest of instructions for saving memory banks.</p>

<p>
<b>SAVE</b><br>
<i>instruction: save one or more memory banks onto disc</i><br>
<b>Save</b> "filename.abk"<br>
<b>Save</b> "filename.abk",bank number</p>
