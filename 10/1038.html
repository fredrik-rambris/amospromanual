<h1>The Parallel Port</h1>

<br>

<p>
This Chapter provides the bridge between the Amiga's Parallel Port and AMOS Professional.
One parallel channel may be opened at a time, so if a printer is already attached to the Parallel
Port, the Parallel device may not be opened at the same time as the Printer device.</p>

<p>In fact, accessing the Parallel device has three main advantages over the Printer device:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It only uses 5k of memory space, compared to the 50k that can be required for the printer
      driver.</li>
  <li>It needs comparatively few system resources.</li>
  <li>It can also be used for input as well as output.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are few disadvantages, although control over sequence conversion is not possible, and
screen dumps cannot be made via the Parallel Port.</p>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL OPEN</b><br>
<i>instruction: open the Parallel Port for reading or writing</i><br>
<b>Parallel Open</b></p>

<p>
This instruction initialises the Parallel Port for use by an AMOS Professional program. The first
time that this command is used in any programming session, the "Parallel.device" driver will be
loaded into memory. If it is not available, you will be prompted to insert the relevant disc
automatically.</p>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL CLOSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: close the parallel port</i><br>
<b>Parallel Close</b></p>

<p>This command simply closes the Parallel port.</p>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL SEND</b><br>
<i>instruction: send a string of characters to the Parallel Port</i><br>
<b>Parallel Send</b> text$</p>

<p>
This is very similar to the PRINTER SEND command, which is explained in <a href="../10/1025.html">Chapter 10.3</a>, except
that text data is transmitted exactly as it appears in the original source string. There is no
translation of code, so that any Escape codes will be interpreted directly by a printer. Please
check your printer documentation for details of allowable control codes.</p>

<p>
If data is output to a printer via the Parallel Port, each line should be terminated by a single line-
feed, which is Chr$(10). This tells the printer to print a new line onto paper, starting at the
current position. If the line-feed is omitted, nothing will appear to happen!
Characters are transmitted using multi-tasking, so your main program will not wait for printing
to be completed, but will continue immediately from the next instruction.</p>
