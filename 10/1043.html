<h1>AREXX</h1>

<br>

<p>
Before the port is opened, AMOS Professional opens the "rexxsyslib.library" file from the libs:
folder, which should be installed on your hard disc. The selected port is then checked for
possible problems, and if it is already opened, an error will be generated and the program
aborted.</p>

<p>
<b>AREXX CLOSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: close a communications port</i><br>
<b>Arexx Close</b></p>

<p>
Use this command to close an open AREXX communications port. If a message has been
received via the port, but is waiting for a response, a "Message not answered" error will be
generated. If you then leave the AMOS Professional program without responding, the port will
be closed with an error code of 20, which is fatal! Please see below, for a further explanation of
these error code values</p>.

<p>
<b>AREXX EXIST</b><br>
<i>function: check availability of a communications port</i><br>
value=<b>Arexx Exist</b>("PORT_NAME")</p>

<p>
This function checks for the presence of the named communications port in the Amiga's
memory.<br>
A value of -1 (True) means that it is available, whereas zero (False) indicates that there is a
problem.</p>

<p>
AREXX EXIST can also be used to check if the AREXX system has been installed. Whenever
AREXX is activated, it opens up two communications ports "AREXX" and "REXX", so the
following example can be used for a test:</p>

<pre>
E> If Arexx Exist("REXX")=0
    Trap Exec "RexxMast" : Rem Load AREXX and trap an error
    If Arexx Exist ("REXX")=0
     Print "Sorry, AREXX cannot be opened!"
    Endif
   Endif
</pre>

<p>
<b>AREXX WAIT</b><br>
<i>instruction: wait for a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
<b>Arexx Wait</b></p>

<p>
This command halts an AMOS Professional program until a message arrives from an AREXX
program. This operation can be aborted at any time as usual, by pressing [Ctrl]+[C] to return to
the AMOS Professional Editor.</p>

<p>
<b>AREXX</b><br>
<i>function: check for a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
status=<b>Arexx</b></p>

<p>
The AREXX function performs a GET MESSAGE command
from the Amiga's operating system.</p>
