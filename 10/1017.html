<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>Disc space</b></p>

<p>
<b>DFREE</b><br>
<i>function: report free space on disc</i><br>
f=<b>Dfree</b></p>

<p>
This simple function returns the amount of free space remaining on the current disc, measured
in bytes.</p>

<p>
<b>DISC INFO$</b><br>
<i>function: report free space of a named device</i><br>
information$=<b>Disc Info$</b>("Name")</p>

<p>
This function is used to return the amount of free space in the specified device. The string that is
returned contains the name of the disc, followed by the amount of free space. Here is an
example which splits the string:</p>

<pre>
E> A$=Disc Info$("Df0:")
   C=Instr(A$,":")
   N$=Left$(A$,C)
   A$=A$-N$
   D=Val(A$)
   Print "Name of the disc=";N$
   Print "Free space=";D
</pre>

<p>
<b>KILL</b><br>
<i>instruction: erase a file from current disc</i><br>
<b>Kill</b> filename$</p>

<p>
Be extremely careful with this command. It obliterates the named file from the current disc, once
and for all. The file that is erased with this command cannot be retrieved.
Kill "Permanently"</p>

<p><b>Disc files</b><br>

Files are simply packages of information stored together at a particular location on disc. Each file
is assigned its own name, which may contain anything from 1 to 255 characters.</p>

<p>
Before a file can be used, it must be initialised using the OPEN IN, OPEN OUT or APPEND
commands, which are explained below. When a file is opened, it must be assigned a channel
number, ranging from 1 to 10. This number will be used in all subsequent disc operations to
identify the file you are currently working with.</p>

<p>
Your Amiga uses two types of disc files: "sequential" files and "random access" files. Here is how
AMOS Professional exploits them fully.</p>
