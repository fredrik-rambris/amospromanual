<h1>Accessing a Printer</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>PRINTER ONLINE</b><br>
<i>function: report if printer is on-line</i><br>
status=<b>Printer Online</b></p>

<p>
This useful function provides a simple method of checking if the printer is connected and ready
for use. It returns a value of -1 (True) if the printer is on-line, otherwise zero (False) will be given.
This function only works with <b>parallel</b> printer devices.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER ERROR</b><br>
<i>function: check for an error in printing operation</i><br>
status=<b>Printer Error</b></p>

<p>
Use this function to check if the current printing operation is proceeding normally. A value of
zero suggests that all is well, but any other value indicates an error.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER BASE</b><br>
<i>function: get the address of printer base</i><br>
address=<b>Printer Base</b></p>

<p>
The PRINTER BASE function is used to return the address of the i/o structure used to control the
printer. It is intended for use by skilled operators only! Poking around the internal device
structures is a very dangerous operation indeed!</p>

<p><b>Other ports and devices</b><br>

The <b>serial</b> Port is examined in the next Chapter, and it is also possible to access the <b>parallel</b> port
directly, which provides a number of advantages over the printer device. Please refer to <a href="1038.html">Chapter
10.5</a> for full details.</p>

<p>
The complete control and exploitation of other devices that control hardware as well as internal
features of the Amiga is dealt with in <a href="../11/1114.html">Chapter 11.5</a>. This Chapter ends with a general instruction
and function for dealing with ports.</p>

<p>
<b>OPEN PORT</b><br>
<i>instruction: open a channel to an 10 port</i><br>
<b>Open Port</b> channel number,"PAR:"<br>
<b>Open Port</b> channel number,"SER:"<br>
<b>Open Port</b> channel number,"PRT:"</p>

<p>
The three versions of the OPEN PORT command are shown above, and they are used to open a
channel to the Parallel Interface, or the RS232 Port, or the printer chosen in your preferences
settings. All standard sequential file commands can be performed as usual, except for commands
that are specific to disc operations, such as LOF and POF.</p>
