<h1>AREXX</h1>

<br>

<p>There are three possible values that can be returned, depending on the message status, as follows:</p>

<p>
Zero indicates that there is no message, so try again later. A value of 1 means that a message has
just arrived, but does not need a response. 2 indicates that a message has been received which
must be answered immediately with an appropriate return string. This function can be used in a
loop, as an alternative to the AREXX WAIT command. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Do
    If Arexx
     Print "A message is waiting!"
    Endif
    Multi Wait
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
<b>AREXX$</b><br>
<i>function: get a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
message$=<b>Arexx$</b>(message number)</p>

<p>
After a message has been successfully received from an AREXX compatible
program, this function can be used to read its contents.</p>

<p>
The number refers to the number of the message you wish to read, ranging from zero to 15. If it
is not included, an empty string will be returned.</p>

<p>
<b>AREXX ANSWER</b><br>
<i>instruction: answer a message from an AREXX program</i><br>
<b>Arexx Answer</b> error value<br>
<b>Arexx Answer</b> error value,return$</p>

<p>
Normally, when a message arrives from an AREXX program, it <b>must</b> be answered without
delay. This command sends back a response to the calling program, with the special result fields
set to the appropriate values. Typical values are:</p>

<pre>
0 No error
5 Warning
10 Severe error
20 Fatal error
</pre>

<p>
If the AREXX program requests a return string, one <b>must</b> be sent back, otherwise the calling
program will be left in limbo awaiting a response. This situation should be checked with the
AREXX function, as explained above, and a return value of 2 means that a reply must be given
immediately.</p>

<p>
The AMOS Professional message system is intelligent, so if you attempt to return a string to an
AREXX program which does not specifically request one, it will not be transmitted. Similarly, if
the AREXX program is waiting for a string, but it is accidentally omitted from the instruction, an
empty string will be sent by AMOS Professional automatically.</p>
