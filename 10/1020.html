<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>SET INPUT</b><br>
<i>instruction: set end-of-line characters</i><br>
<b>Set Input</b> code1,code2</p>

<p>
SET INPUT is used to set which characters you want to input to end a line of data. Many
computers need both a [Return] and [line feed] character at the end of each line, but the Amiga
only needs a [line feed]. This means that if you wanted to import files from an ST via the serial
cable, for example, unwanted [Return] characters would litter your input.</p>

<p>
SET INPUT solves this problem by allowing you to select two Ascii values as your end-of-line
characters. If you prefer to use a single character only, make the second value a negative
number. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Set Input 10,-1 : Rem Standard Amiga format
   Set Input 13,10: Rem ST compatible format
</pre>

<p>
<b>INPUT$</b><br>
<i>function: input a fixed number of characters from a device</i><br>
i$=<b>Input$</b>(file,count)</p>

<p>
Use this function to input a set number of characters from a device or file. The parameters in
brackets refer to the filename or device, followed by the count of characters to be input.</p>

<p>
<b>EOF</b><br>
<i>function: test for end of file</i><br>
flag=<b>Eof</b>(channel)</p>

<p>
This tests to see if the end of a file has been reached at the current reading position, returning -1
for yes and 0 if this has not happened.</p>

<p>
<b>LOF</b><br>
<i>function: give length of an open file</i><br>
length=<b>Lof</b>(channel)</p>

<p>
LOF returns the length of an open file, and it would be pointless to use this function with
devices other than the current disc.</p>

<p>
<b>POF</b><br>
<i>reserved variable: hold current position of file pointer</i><br>
position=<b>Pof</b>(channel)</p>

<p>
This changes the current reading or writing position of an open file. For example, the following
line sets the read/write position to 1,000 characters past the start of the file:</p>

<pre>
X> Pof(1)=1000
</pre>

<p>
Because disc drives are inherently random, this may be used to provide
a crude form of random access with sequential files.</p>
