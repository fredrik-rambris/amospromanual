<h1>Accessing a Printer</h1>

<br>

<p>
The section of screen to be dumped is set by giving the top left-hand coordinates followed by
the coordinates of the corner diagonally opposite.</p>

<p>
The third option allows you to change the size parameters and aspect ratio of the original screen
image. This is achieved by including additional parameters after x1,y1 and x2,y2, as follows:</p>

<p>
Px and py specify the dimensions of the final print-out, and these values are measured in
printer pixels rather than normal screen pixels. Printer pixels vary in size, depending on the
command options that are given by the following settings:</p>

<p>
Settings refers to a special command parameter, that is used to tell the printer precisely how to
draw the current screen image on paper. Here is a list of these settings, which can be combined
using AND as well as OR operations from AMOS Professional.</p>

<pre>
<b>Value    Name          Description</b>
$0001    MILCOLS       px is in 1/1000" (see Note 1)
$0002    MILROWS       py is in 1/1000"
$0004    FULLCOLS      use maximum print width (see Note 2)
$0008    FULLROWS      use maximum print height
$0010    FRACCOLS      px is a fraction of FULLCOLS (see Note 3)
$0020    FRACROWS      py is a fraction of FULLROWS
$0040    CENTRE        centre the image on the page
$0080    ASPECT        retain the original aspect ratio
$0100    DENSITY1      set resolution (dots per inch)
$0200    DENSITY2      next resolution
$0300    DENSITY3      next resolution
$0400    DENSITY4      next resolution
$0500    DENSITY5      next resolution
$0600    DENSITY6      next resolution
$0700    DENSITY7      set resolution
$0800    NOFORM FEED   do not eject paper
$1000    TRUSTME       do not re-set
$2000    NOPRINT       do not print
</pre>

<p>
Note 1. MILCOLS and MILROWS measure the px and py parameters in units of 1/1000th of an
inch. So if px=10000, the print-out will measure ten inches wide.</p>

<p>
Note 2. FULLCOLS and FULLROWS make use of the maximum available width and height of
the paper.</p>

<p>
Note 3. FRACCOLS and FRACROWS specify the width and height of the print-out as a fraction
of the current paper size.</p>

<p>
Px,py are assumed to be between $0000 and $FFFF, and the print width is calculated using the
formula width =FULLCOLS*px/$FFFF whereas height is calculated by the formula
height=FULLROWS*py/$FFFF.<br>

This means that if px =$8000 the print width will be $8000/$FFF,
which equals half of FULLCOLS. So the pint-out will take up half the width of the paper.</p>
