<h1>Accessing a Serial Port</h1>

<br>

<p>
When the SERIAL OPEN command is called for the first time, the Serial Device library is loaded
from the System disc automatically, so make sure that this disc is available in the current drive.</p>

<p>
<b>SERIAL CLOSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: close one or more Serial channels</i><br>
<b>Serial Close</b><br>
<b>Serial Close</b> Channel number</p>

<p>
The use of this instruction closes all currently opened serial channels with no check for any
errors. If an optional channel number is given, the specified channel will be closed using all
normal error checks.</p>

<p>
Whenever a program is run from AMOS Professional, any opened channels will be closed
automatically.</p>

<p><b>Setting the serial parameters</b><br>

The default settings for Serial Channels correspond to the standard Minitel protocol used in
France, as follows:</p>

<pre>
1200 Baud
7 bits
1 stop bit
Even parity.
</pre>

<p>These settings can be changed using the instructions that are explained next.</p>

<p>
<b>SERIAL SPEED</b><br>
<i>instruction: set transfer rate for a serial channel</i><br>
<b>Serial Speed</b> Channel number,Baud rate</p>

<p>
This sets the current data transfer rate (the Baud rate) of the given channel, for both the sending
and receiving operations. A Baud rate cannot be split for a. single channel. If the specified
transfer rate is not supported by the current serial device, it may be rejected by the system.</p>

<p>
<b>SERIAL BITS</b><br>
<i>instruction: set the number of bits for transmission of characters</i><br>
<b>Serial Bits</b> Channel number,number of bits,number of Stop bits</p>

<p>
This command is used to assign the number of bits that are to be used for each character that is
transmitted. After the channel number is specified, give the number of bits followed by the
number of Stop bits to be used.</p>

<p>
<b>SERIAL PARITY</b><br>
<i>instruction: set parity checking for a serial channel</i><br>
<b>Serial Parity</b> Channel number, Parity</p>

<p>
The SERIAL PARITY instruction sets the parity checking to be used for the specified
serial channel.</p>
