<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<b>IBM and ST users</b><br>

The commercially available Cross Dos package allows AMOS Professional to access discs in IBM-
clone format or Atari-ST format. Discs that are in either of these formats are identified by a three-
character code of the two letters "Di" followed by the number of your drive. So an ST format
disc in the Amiga's internal drive would be named as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> Di0:
</pre>

<p>
Because AMOS Basic evolved from STOS (Atari) Basic, every effort has been made to help STOS
users convert their programs to AMOS Professional. STOS programs should be saved to disc in
Ascii format using the [FSAVE] "*.ASC" option. This disc should be inserted into an Amiga
floppy disc drive that has been mounted by Cross Dos as an IBM drive.</p>

<p>
Certain STOS programs will need modification before they will run under AMOS Professional,
but you will be rewarded by the fact that the Amiga's superior power over the ST can transform
your programs for the better!</p>
