<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<p>Now try this example:</p>

<pre>
E> Open Random 1,"ADDRESS"
   Field 1,25 As NAME$,12 As TEL$
   Do
    Input "Enter Record Number: ";INDEX
    If INDEX=0 Then Exit
    Get 1,INDEX
    Print NAME$ : Print TEL$
   Loop
   Close 1
</pre>

<b>Included files</b><br>

The AMOS Professional Editor cannot rationalise your source code around the entire memory of
the Amiga. This means that if you are editing an extremely long program, the insertion of a line
can be tedious. It can take a few seconds to move the memory around before allowing the next
line to be inserted.</p>

<p>
To assist the editing of lengthy programs in assembly language or C, an Include facility is
provided. AMOS Professional programmers can enjoy exactly the same benefit!</p>

<p>
<b>INCLUDE</b><br>
<i>instruction: specify a file for inclusion when testing a program</i><br>
<b>Include</b> "File_To_Include.AMOS"</p>

<p>
The INCLUDE command must occupy a line on its own, otherwise the specified file will not be
detected , and so it will not be included. The effect of INCLUDE on a file is as follows:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Immediately before a program is tested, AMOS Professional scans the beginning of each
      program line for an INCLUDE instruction.</li>
  <li>If an INCLUDE is encountered, AMOS Professional opens the specified file, reads its length
      and checks its validity.</li>
  <li>This process takes place for each INCLUDE that is found, in order.</li>
  <li>A memory buffer is reserved for the total length of the re-created program.</li>
  <li>AMOS Professional now copies sections of the source program, without the Includes, and
      loads the files from disc.</li>
  <li>All files are now closed, and with the memory buffer holding the re-created program, the
      testing process begins as normal.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will need enough memory to hold the original buffer space and the included files at the
same time for this process to operate, but if your program is large enough to slow down the
Editor it is obvious that you have access to a reasonable amount of memory.</p>

<p>
Please note that included files are only supported in the original source, and an INCLUDE in an
included file will generate an error when the program is run. The re-created buffer is erased as
soon as the program is left, so the specified files must be loaded every time the program is
tested. If programs are included which have memory banks, these banks will be left out.</p>
