<h1>Accessing a Printer</h1>

<br>

<p>
AMOS Professional offers total access to the Amiga's printer driver. The printer configuration is
taken directly from your Preferences settings, allowing printer control with a standard set of
"escape codes".</p>

<p>Any AMOS Professional screen can also be dumped directly onto paper via your printer.</p>

<p><b>The printer device</b><br>

Details of your printer are taken from the settings that have been previously entered from the
Workbench Preferences utility. A printer can be connected to the Serial Port or the Parallel Port,
mid AMOS Professional will choose the appropriate device for all printing operations
automatically.</p>

<p>
The first time that a printer is used, the printer drivers are loaded into memory from your start-
up disc. If this is not available, a requester will be displayed enabling you to insert the relevant
disc.</p>

<p>
The printer driver consumes a great deal Of memory, and can require up to 50k in order to
operate. If available memory is running short, it may be easier to access the printer with the
SERIAL or PARALLEL commands instead. Additionally, if multi-tasking is being used, it is
important to realise that only one program is allowed to access the printer device at any one
time. If a previous program has already grabbed the printer, an error message will be generated
when an attempt is made to access the printer from an AMOS Professional program.</p>

<p>Such errors can be trapped using a command like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Trap Printer Open
   If ERRTRAP : Print "Cannot open Printer Device!" : Endif
</pre>

<p>
<b>PRINTER OPEN</b><br>
<i>instruction: open the standard printer device for use</i><br>
<b>Printer Open</b></p>

<p>This command opens the printer device using your current preferences.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER CLOSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: close printer port</i><br>
<b>Printer Close</b></p>

<p>
Use this instruction to close the printer port that has been previously set with a PRINTER OPEN
command. Note that the memory is not freed for use by your AMOS Professional program
immediately. Memory is only returned if the following conditions are met: firstly, that no other
program has requested the printer device during multi-tasking, as explained above. Secondly, if
the system becomes short of memory and requires more.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER SEND</b><br>
<i>instruction: send a string to the printer</i><br>
<b>Printer Send</b> text$</p>

<p>
The PRINTER SEND command sends a string of text to the printer,
using multi-tasking.</p>
