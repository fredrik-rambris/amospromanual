<h1>Using the Keyboard</h1>

<br>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Print "Type in a number"
   Input A
   Print "Your number was ";A
   Input "Type in a floating point number";N#
   Print "Your number was ";N#
   Input "What's your name?";Name$
   Locate 23, : Print "Hello ";Name$
</pre>

<p>
<b>LINE INPUT</b><br>
<i>instruction: input a list of variables separated by [Return]</i><br>
<b>Line Input</b> variables;<br>
<b>Line Input</b> "Prompt string";variables;</p>

<p>
LINE INPUT is identical in usage to INPUT, except that is uses a press of the [Return] key to
separate each value you enter via the keyboard instead of a comma. Try this:</p>

<pre>
E> Line Input "Type in three numbers";A,B,C
   Print A,B,C
</pre>

<p>
<b>PUT KEY</b><br>
<i>instruction:load a string into the keyboard buffer</i><br>
<b>Put Key</b> a$</p>

<p>
This command loads a string of characters directly into the keyboard buffer, and it is most
commonly used to set up defaults for your INPUT routines. Note that end of line returns can be
included using a CHR$(13) character. In the next example, "NO" is assigned to the default
INPUT string.</p>

<pre>
E> Do
    Put Key "NO"
    Input "Do you love me, Yes or No: ";A$
    B$=Upper$(A$)
    If B$="NO" Then Boom : Wait 50: Exit
   Loop
</pre>

<p><b>Keyboard Macros</b><br>

AMOS Professional allows the creation of keyboard macros from the [Macros] option of the
main [Editor] Menu, as detailed in <a href="../4/401.html">Chapter 4.1</a>. A macro is simply a command string assigned to
one of the function keys, which is called up by pressing the appropriate function key and one of
the [Amiga] keys together. Once a macro has been defined, it can be used anywhere within the
AMOS Professional system, and will have exactly the same effect as if the assigned commands
had been entered from the keyboard. The same macro can be called from the Editor window,
from Direct mode, or from inside an AMOS Professional program.</p>

<p>
As well as assigning macro definitions by means of the [Macro] option in the Editor,
they can also be defined directly from an AMOS Professional program using
the powerful KEY$ reserved variable.</p>
