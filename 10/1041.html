<h1>AREXX</h1>

<br>

<p>
AREXX is a separate programming language which is included with Workbench 2. It has been
carefully designed to make efficient use of the Amiga's powerful multi-tasking system. Please
consult your AREXX documentation from Commodore concerning the intricacies of this
language, this User Guide concerns AMOS Professional programming!. It will now be explained
how AMOS Professional supports the AREXX system.</p>

<p>
The Amiga is capable of running several different programs simultaneously. Each application
can have its own memory area and separate screen window, so AMOS Professional is able to
occupy your screen while a word-processor or communications package is working diligently in
the background. If there is enough memory available, you may run as many programs as you
like, and flick between them instantly.</p>

<p>
AREXX allows you to achieve much more! It provides a standard communication facility
between the various programs running on an Amiga, so if an event like an E-mail message
happens, it can be displayed directly from AMOS Professional.</p>

<p>
It is also possible to run one program from another by remote control. For example, a specialist
word-processor could be called from AMOS Professional, and the current program listing could
be passed over for immediate editing. The edited listing could then be re-loaded into AMOS
Professional and tested on screen, in one operation.</p>

<p>
In order to fully exploit these features, a lot of memory and a fast hard disc is required.
Unexpanded machines will be unable to make use of these features.</p>

<b>Using AREXX</b><br>

AMOS Professional has an advanced internal control system, and a small AMOS Professional
program is needed to serve as an intermediary to an AREXX-compatible editor. The AMOS
Professional program can now be run as an Editor Accessory, and external commands can be
translated into the appropriate ASK EDITOR and CALL EDITOR instructions.</p>

<p>
AREXX can be called in several ways. To install it from AMOS Professional, an EXEC command
can be used, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> Exec "RexxMast"
</pre>

<p>
The EXEC instruction calls up the resident MASTER process, and loads it into memory
permanently. Naturally, this can only work if AREXX has been installed onto the appropriate
hard disc system. Please check your Workbench 2 manual for the required procedure.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, AREXX can be run from the CLI prompt with a REXXMAST command. This
command can be inserted into your start-up sequence, so that it is run automatically whenever
your Amiga is used. AREXX will now be available from your applications.</p>

<p>
It is important to realise that not all programs can make use of the AREXX interface, and the
relevant documentation should be checked before proceeding. Here is the general procedure.</p>
