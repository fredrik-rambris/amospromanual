<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Run "Next level.AMOS"
</pre>

<p>
This method is known as "chaining" programs together. When programs run like this, data
screens and banks will be kept, allowing you to pass data and display a screen of graphics while
the next level is loading. But the redundant last program will be erased to make room for the
new program, so you should remember the fact that any variables will be lost in the process.</p>

<p>
In fact, AMOS Professional does allow you to pass variable data from one program to another,
by making use of "Command Lines".</p>

<p>
<b>COMMAND LINE$</b><br>
<i>reserved variable: transfer parameters between programs</i><br>
c$=<b>Command Lines$</b></p>

<p>
Data for hi-scores, messages, names and so on can be carried through to the next level of
computer game by the following method.</p>

<p>Type in the next example program:</p>

<pre>
E> Rem Program 1
   Screen Open 0,640,200,4.Hires
   Rem greetings sent by previous program
   Print "Greetings from Program 2:";Command Line$
   Input "Please type in a greeting!";A$
   Command Line$=A$
   Print "Running Program 2!" : Wait 100
   Run "Program2.AMOS"
</pre>

<p>
Now save that example on a suitable disc, and name it "Program1.AMOS". Next, change that
example program as follows:</p>

<pre>
E> Rem Program 2
   Screen Open 0.320,200,4,Lowres
   Rem Greetings sent by previous program
   Print "Greetings from Program 1:";Command Line$
   Input "Please type in a greeting!";A$
   Command Line$=A$
   Print "Running Program 1!"
   Wait 100
   Run "Program1.AMOS"
</pre>

<p>
Save Program 2, and call it "Program2.AMOS". Now run Program 2, which should still be in
memory. After the first blank communication, the two programs will greet one another until you
break into their conversation with [Ctrl]+[C].</p>
