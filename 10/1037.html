<h1>Accessing a Serial Port</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>SERIAL ABORT</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop current data transfer</i><br>
<b>Serial Abort</b>(channel number)</p>

<p>
This command halts any serial operations that have been commenced by a SERIAL SEND or
SERIAL OUT command, and leaves the channel clear. It allows an instant quit from a transfer,
without the need to wait for current activities to be completed.</p>

<p>
<b>SERIAL BASE</b><br>
<i>function: get the address of the serial base</i><br>
address=<b>Serial Base</b></p>

<p>
The SERIAL BASE function is especially useful for systems programmers. It returns the base
address of the i/o structure of the current serial channel, allowing system functions to be called
directly from an AMOS Professional program with EXEC. You are warned not to use this
function unless you know precisely what you are doing, otherwise any mistakes can crash your
computer.</p>
