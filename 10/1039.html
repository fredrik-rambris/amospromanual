<h1>The Parallel Port</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL OUT</b><br>
<i>instruction: send data from memory to the Parallel Port</i><br>
<b>Parallel Out</b> address,length</p>

<p>
This instruction is similar to the PRINTER OUT command, and transmits the specified number
of characters defined by the length parameter, starting from a given address.</p>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL INPUT$</b><br>
<i>function: read a string from the Parallel Port</i><br>
text$=<b>Parallel Input$</b>(length[,stop])</p>

<p>
The PARALLEL INPUTS function waits for a specific number of characters from the Parallel
Port. Because this port does not have an internal buffer area, the AMOS Professional program
will halt completely until all characters have been successfully received. If the requested bytes
have not arrived after a reasonable amount of time, a time-out error will be generated. This may
be detected using the TRAP instruction, explained in <a href="../12/1207.html">Chapter 12.2</a>.</p>

<p>
The PARALLEL INPUTS parameters are as follows: length holds the number of characters to be
received. The square brackets can hold an optional stop character, which will end the
transmission as soon as it is encountered anywhere in an input string.</p>

<p>
If you intend to devise a communications protocol using the Parallel Port, then the first item to
send should be the total number of bytes to be transmitted!</p>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL ABORT</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop a parallel operation</i><br>
<b>Parallel Abort</b></p>

<p>
This command is used to stop a PARALLEL SEND or PARALLEL OUT instruction from
transmitting any additional information via the Parallel Port. Any characters that are currently in
transit will be completely lost.</p>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL CHECK</b><br>
<i>function: report the availability of the Parallel Port</i><br>
value=<b>Parallel Check</b></p>

<p>
The PARALLEL CHECK function is used to return the readiness of the Parallel Port. The status
is returned by either a value of zero (False) if it is not available, or -1 (True) if the port is ready for
use.</p>

<p>
<b>PARALLEL ERROR</b><br>
<i>function: check for an error in transmission via the Parallel Port</i><br>
value=<b>Parallel Error</b></p>

To check for errors during the current transmission via the Parallel Port, use this function.
