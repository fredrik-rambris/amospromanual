<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<p>That line would result in this amended display:</p>

<pre>
AMA
AMI
AMI
AMU
</pre>

<p>
It is possible to ignore several file-paths at once, as long as each name is terminated with a single
oblique character "/". For example:</p>

<pre>
D> Set Dir 8,"*.AMOS/*.IFF/*.Abk"
</pre>

<p>
<b>DIR$</b><br>
<i>function: change the current directory</i><br>
s$=<b>Dir$</b><br>
<b>Dir$</b>=s$</p>

<p>
The DIR$ function is used to contain the directory that will be used as the starting point for all
future disc operations, such as loading and saving.</p>

<pre>
E> Print Dir$ : Rem Print out current directory
   Rem Set directory to folder
   Dir$="AMOSPro_Examples:IFF/"
</pre>

<p>
DIR$ is similar to the CD command from the CLI, with the advantage of allowing you to read
the directory as well as change it. All directories are assumed to be relative to the directory in
current use, and AMOS Professional will only search the current directory for a folder. To avoid
this problem, include the name of your disc as in the above example, or use the drive name as
follows:</p>

<pre>
D> Dir$="Df0:IFF/"
</pre>

<p>
<b>PARENT</b><br>
<i>instruction: negotiate a path through current directory</i><br>
<b>Parent</b></p>

<p>
Because directories can be "nested" inside one another, files can be organised according to a
range of categories. Although this is very convenient, it is not difficult to get lost in a maze of
nested files. In the following example, the folder named FOLDERA is stored in the main
directory (the "root" directory) and can be regarded as the "parent" of FOLDERB and
FOLDERD. Similarly, FOLDERB is the parent of FOLDERC:</p>

<pre>
FOLDERA/
 FOLDER B/
  FOLDERC/
 FOLDERD/
</pre>
