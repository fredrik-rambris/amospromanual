<h1>Accessing a Serial Port</h1>

<br>

<p>
Here is the Chapter which explains how AMOS Professional is used as the gateway to the world
of computerised communications.</p>

<p>
The I/O Extension provides you with all the commands needed to exploit the Amiga's serial port
for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Long-distance multi-user games played between any number of Amiga users.</li>
  <li>Network communications between desks, offices, classrooms and continents!</li>
  <li>MIDI interfacing for musicians, between the Amiga and synthesizers, drum machines and
      sequencers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Opening the Serial Port</b><br>

A serial device refers to any machine that can communicate with the Amiga via its Serial Port.
These devices include modems, MIDI systems and of course, other Amigas.</p>

<p>
<b>SERIAL OPEN</b><br>
<i>instruction: open a channel for Serial Input/Output</i><br>
<b>Serial Open</b> Channel number,Port number<br>
<b>Serial Open</b> Channel number, Port number,Shared,Xmode,7wires</p>

<p>
The SERIAL OPEN command is used to open a communication channel between the Amiga and
a serial device. The following parameters can be given with this instruction:</p>

<p>
The Channel number is an identification number that will be used for <b>all</b> subsequent
communication commands. The values for this number range from zero to 3.</p>

<p>
The Port number is normally set to zero, and it specifies the logical device number of the Serial
Port. For Amigas equipped with a Multi-Serial card that offers additional Serial Ports, these extra
ports can be accessed by specifying a Port number from 1 upwards.</p>

<p>There are three optional parameters that can also be given, as follows:</p>

<p>
The Shared parameter refers to a value which acts as a flag, telling AMOS Professional that the
serial device can be shared with other tasks that are currently running on the computer. In other
words, this parameter is used for multi-tasking. A value of zero (False) will grab the specified
channel for AMOS Professional programs, and will deny access to any other programs. A value
of -1 (True) will allow the Serial Port to be shared between several programs in memory. You are
warned to use this system with great care, to avoid crashing your Amiga.</p>

<p>
The Xmode is a val.-Lie which is used to toggle the checking system known as XON/XOFF. This
system makes checks during the transmission of data over a serial line. It is essential to set this
flag when the device is first opened, even if the device will not be required until later. The
default value is zero (False), and this means that the system is normally disabled. To enable the
checking system, a value of -1 (True) must be set. Once the port has been opened, the XON and
XOFF characters must be set using a SERIAL X command, which is explained later.</p>

<p>
The last of the three optional parameters concerns the "7 wires system" of communication.
The default value for this parameter is set to zero (False), and a value of -1 (True)
tells the device to use this system.</p>
