<h1>Accessing a Printer</h1>

<br>

<p>
For example, to dump a 100x100 section of the current screen onto a full page, retaining the
correct aspect ratio, the following line would be used:</p>

<pre>
X> Printer Dump 0,0 To 100,100,0,0,$80 Or $8 Or $4
</pre>

<p>The next example could be used for printing a low resolution screen to an eight by six inch area:</p>

<pre>
X> Printer Dump 0,0 To 320,200,8000,6000,$1 Or $2
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, part of the current screen could be dumped utilising the maximum available
height, but with the width reduced by one third, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> Printer Dump 0,0 To 200,200,$5555,0,$8 Or $10
</pre>

<p>
You are warned not to attempt to change the current screen during a screen dump operation,
otherwise the resultant print-out will become scrambled.</p>

<p><b>Other printer commands</b></p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER OUT</b><br>
<i>instruction: print data from an address</i><br>
<b>Printer Out</b> address,length</p>

<p>
This command is used to print some data directly from the memory location starting at a
specified address. The data is not processed in any way, so embedded control sequences will be
completely ignored. The PRINTER OUT instruction should be used to send simple text and
graphics only.</p>

<p>
The address parameter refers to the first character which is to be output, and length specifies the
number of characters to be printed. To send a string, the following type of line would be used:</p>

<pre>
Printer Out Varptr(A$),Len(A$)
</pre>

<p>
Similarly to PRINTER SEND, it must be ensured that data remains unchanged during the
printing process, otherwise the resultant print-out will become corrupted.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER ABORT</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop a printer operation</i><br>
<b>Printer Abort</b></p>

<p>
This command halts the current printing operation. If your printer device has a large memory
buffer, there may be a delay before the printing ceases.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER CHECK</b><br>
<i>function: return the status of the printer</i><br>
status=<b>Printer Check</b></p>

<p>
Use the PRINTER CHECK function to return a value of -1 (True) if the printer
is available for use, or zero (False) if it is in active mid-operation.</p>
