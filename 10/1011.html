<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>LDIR</b><br>
<b>LDIRAN</b><br>
<i>instructions: output directory of current disc to printer</i><br>
<b>Ldir</b><br>
<b>Ldir</b> path$<br>
<b>Ldir/W</b><br>
<b>Ldir</b> path$ <b>/W</b></p>

<p>
These two commands are used in exactly the same way as DIR and DIR/W, as explained above,
and they list the directory of the current disc to a printer.</p>

<p>
<b>SET DIR</b><br>
<i>instruction: set directory style</i><br>
<b>Set Dir</b> number<br>
<b>Set Dir</b> number,filter$</p>

<p>
This command must be followed by a number ranging from 1 to 100, which sets the number of
characters to be displayed from each filename. There is no effect on the names themselves, only
on the way they are displayed. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Set Dir 6
   Dir
</pre>

<p>
An optional string may be added to a SET DIR command, which has the effect of filtering out
pathnames from the directory search. All filenames that match up with this filer will be
completely ignored. Supposing a directory began like this:</p>

<pre>
AMO.IFF
AMAL
AMAT.IFF
AMINIBUS
AMINOACID
AMENSROOM.IFF
AMULET
</pre>

<p>
SET DIR may now be used to restrict the display to three characters, as well as filtering out any
IFF files, as follows:</p>

<pre>
D> Set Dir 5,".IFF"
</pre>

<p>
The first two characters displayed are folder markers, this is why the value five is used instead of
three.</p>
