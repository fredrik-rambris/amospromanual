<h1>Disc Access</h1>

<br>

<p>
For example, the directory containing the current fonts used by AMOS Professional is called
FONTS: whereas the SAY command uses a library file that can be examined by typing the
following line from Direct Mode:</p>

<pre>
D> Dir "Libs:"
</pre>

<p>
<b>DIR</b><br>
<i>instruction: print directory of the current disc</i><br>
<b>Dir</b><br>
<b>Dir</b> path$</p>

<p>
The DIR command is used to examine the directory of the current disc and list all of its files on
screen, like this:</p>

<pre>
D> Dir
</pre>

<p>
Any folders in the listing will be distinguished by a leading asterisk character *. The listing can
be stopped at any time by pressing the [Space-bar] and then started again in the same way. Note
that if you change discs without informing AMOS Professional and then try to get a directory
listing, you may be presented with a system requester. The simple solution is to re-insert the
requested disc and try again.</p>

<p>
<b>DIR/W</b><br>
<i>instruction: print out directory in two columns</i><br>
<b>Dir/W</b><br>
<b>Dir</b> paths$<b> /W</b></p>

<p>
This command performs exactly the same task as DIR, but displays the list of files in two
separate columns across the screen. So by using this double width, twice as many filenames can
appear on screen at any one time.</p>

<p>
There is no need for DIR or DIR/W to list every file on the disc. Certain files or groups of files can
be extracted by specifying optional "pathways", so that only files which satisfy a certain set of
conditions are listed.</p>

<p>
The broadest of these paths gives the name of the disc or the drive to be examined. A colon must
be added to the disc name, like this:</p>

<pre>
E> Dir "FONTS:"
   Dir "Dh0:"
</pre>

<p>
The next selective category that can be defined is a single folder of filenames to be listed. For
example:</p>

<pre>
X> Dir "Objects/"
   Dir "AMOSPro_Examples:Objects/"
</pre>
