<h1>Accessing a Printer</h1>

<br>


<p>
AMOS Professional offers total access to the Amiga's printer driver. The printer configuration is
taken directly from your Preferences settings, allowing printer control with a standard set of
"escape codes".</p>

<p>Any AMOS Professional screen can also be dumped directly onto paper via your printer.</p>

<p><b>The printer device</b><br>

Details of your printer are taken from the settings that have been previously entered from the
Workbench Preferences utility. A printer can be connected to the Serial Port or the Parallel Port,
mid AMOS Professional will choose the appropriate device for all printing operations
automatically.</p>

<p>
The first time that a printer is used, the printer drivers are loaded into memory from your start-
up disc. If this is not available, a requester will be displayed enabling you to insert the relevant
disc.</p>

<p>
The printer driver consumes a great deal Of memory, and can require up to 50k in order to
operate. If available memory is running short, it may be easier to access the printer with the
SERIAL or PARALLEL commands instead. Additionally, if multi-tasking is being used, it is
important to realise that only one program is allowed to access the printer device at any one
time. If a previous program has already grabbed the printer, an error message will be generated
when an attempt is made to access the printer from an AMOS Professional program.</p>

<p>Such errors can be trapped using a command like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Trap Printer Open
   If ERRTRAP : Print "Cannot open Printer Device!" : Endif
</pre>

<p>
<b>PRINTER OPEN</b><br>
<i>instruction: open the standard printer device for use</i><br>
<b>Printer Open</b></p>

<p>This command opens the printer device using your current preferences.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER CLOSE</b><br>
<i>instruction: close printer port</i><br>
<b>Printer Close</b></p>

<p>
Use this instruction to close the printer port that has been previously set with a PRINTER OPEN
command. Note that the memory is not freed for use by your AMOS Professional program
immediately. Memory is only returned if the following conditions are met: firstly, that no other
program has requested the printer device during multi-tasking, as explained above. Secondly, if
the system becomes short of memory and requires more.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER SEND</b><br>
<i>instruction: send a string to the printer</i><br>
<b>Printer Send</b> text$</p>

<p>
The PRINTER SEND command sends a string of text to the printer,
using multi-tasking.</p>

<!-- section -->

<p>
The command does not wait for the text to be printed, and returns immediately to the program.
All printing operations are performed "invisibly" in the background. Obviously, if the printer is
not ready, the appropriate requester will appear.</p>

<p><b>Embedded commands</b><br>

The text string to be printed can contain embedded commands, and these will be converted into
the appropriate control sequences for the current printer automatically. This means that all the
effects such as underline, bold, italic and subscript can be included in your programs.</p>

<p>
Most embedded commands begin with an "Escape" character, or Chr$(27), and they will work
equally well on <b>any</b> printer. Provided that your particular printer has been installed using the
Preferences utility, the entire system will be completely transparent. Here are the rules of
successful printing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each line of text should be terminated by a single Line Feed. Normally this will be Chr$(10),
      but an embedded command can also be used like this:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
X> LF$=Chr$(27)+"E"
   Printer Send "Greetings" +LF$
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>The LF +CR settings found in the AMOS_Interpreter configuration menus are ignored!</li>
  <li>Zeros are printed as normal characters.</li>
  <li>The PRINTER SEND command should not be used to output raw data. Such data may contain
      embedded commands that can be misinterpreted by the printer device.</li>
  <li>Because PRINTER SEND uses multi--tasking, there may be a slight delay while the text string
      is being printed.</li>
  <li>If any changes are made to a string while it is being output, the final print-out may become
      corrupted.</li>
  <li>To avoid unwanted "garbage collection", such an operation can be forced <b>before</b> transmission
      begins of data to be printed, with a line such as X =Free.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is a list of the most useful embedded commands. Note that ESC is simply a standard name
for the CHR$(27) character.</p>


<pre>
<b>Name    Code      Effect</b>
aRIS    ESCc      hard re-set
aRIN    ESC#1     initialise to defaults
aIND    ESCD      true line-feed
aNEL    ESCE      line-feed. This is to be added after every line!
aRI     ESCM      reverse line-feed
aSGRO   ESC[Om    normal character set
aSGR3   ESC[3m    Italics on
aSGR23  ESC[23m   Italics off
aSGR4   ESC[4m    underline on
aSGR24  ESC[24m   underline off
aSGR1   ESC[1m    boldface on
</pre>

<!-- section -->

<pre>
aSGR22     ESC[22m   normal pitch
aSHORP2    ESC[2w    Elite on
aSHORP1    ESC[1w    Elite off
aSHORP4    ESC[4w    condensed on
aSHORP3    ESC[3w    condensed off
aSHORP6    ESC[6w    enlarged on
aSHORP5    ESC[5w    enlarged off
aDEN6      ESC[6"z   shadow print on
aDEN5      ESC[5"z   shadow print off
aDEN4      ESC[4"z   double-strike on
aDEN3      ESC[3"z   double-strike off
aDEN2      ESC[2"z   near-letter-quality on
aDEN1      ESC[1"z   near-letter-quality off
aSUS2      ESC[2v    superscript on
aSUS1      ESC[1v    superscript off
aSUS       ESC[4v    subscript on
aSUS3      ESC3v     subscript off
</pre>

<p>
In order to print a text string in Italics and underlined, for example, the following routine could
be used:</p>

<pre>
X> ESC$=Chr$(27)
   LF$=ESC$+"E"
   Printer Open
   Printer Send ESC$+"[3m"+ESC$+[4m"+"Greetings!"+LF$
   Printer Close
</pre>

<p>
The state of printer output can be monitored by the PRINTER CHECK and PRINTER ERROR
functions, and printing can be abandoned completely using PRINTER ABORT, which are all
explained later.</p>

<p><b>Screen dumps</b><br>

There are three alternative ways of using the PRINTER DUMP command to perform a screen
dump.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER DUMP</b><br>
<i>instruction: print the contents of an AMOS Professional screen</i><br>
<b>Printer Dump</b><br>
<b>Printer Dump</b> x1 ,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2<br>
<b>Printer Dump</b> x1 ,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2,px,py,setting</p>

<p>
Used without any parameters, PRINTER DUMP will perform an entire screen dump in a single
operation. If the screen contains complex graphics, this may well take a considerable time to
complete.</p>

<p>
A selected area of the screen can be transmitted to the printer, retaining the current aspect ratio
and screen size. In other words, if only half of the current display is to be printed,
it will take up exactly half of the space of a complete print-out.</p>

<!-- section -->

<p>
The section of screen to be dumped is set by giving the top left-hand coordinates followed by
the coordinates of the corner diagonally opposite.</p>

<p>
The third option allows you to change the size parameters and aspect ratio of the original screen
image. This is achieved by including additional parameters after x1,y1 and x2,y2, as follows:</p>

<p>
Px and py specify the dimensions of the final print-out, and these values are measured in
printer pixels rather than normal screen pixels. Printer pixels vary in size, depending on the
command options that are given by the following settings:</p>

<p>
Settings refers to a special command parameter, that is used to tell the printer precisely how to
draw the current screen image on paper. Here is a list of these settings, which can be combined
using AND as well as OR operations from AMOS Professional.</p>

<pre>
<b>Value    Name          Description</b>
$0001    MILCOLS       px is in 1/1000" (see Note 1)
$0002    MILROWS       py is in 1/1000"
$0004    FULLCOLS      use maximum print width (see Note 2)
$0008    FULLROWS      use maximum print height
$0010    FRACCOLS      px is a fraction of FULLCOLS (see Note 3)
$0020    FRACROWS      py is a fraction of FULLROWS
$0040    CENTRE        centre the image on the page
$0080    ASPECT        retain the original aspect ratio
$0100    DENSITY1      set resolution (dots per inch)
$0200    DENSITY2      next resolution
$0300    DENSITY3      next resolution
$0400    DENSITY4      next resolution
$0500    DENSITY5      next resolution
$0600    DENSITY6      next resolution
$0700    DENSITY7      set resolution
$0800    NOFORM FEED   do not eject paper
$1000    TRUSTME       do not re-set
$2000    NOPRINT       do not print
</pre>

<p>
Note 1. MILCOLS and MILROWS measure the px and py parameters in units of 1/1000th of an
inch. So if px=10000, the print-out will measure ten inches wide.</p>

<p>
Note 2. FULLCOLS and FULLROWS make use of the maximum available width and height of
the paper.</p>

<p>
Note 3. FRACCOLS and FRACROWS specify the width and height of the print-out as a fraction
of the current paper size.</p>

<p>
Px,py are assumed to be between $0000 and $FFFF, and the print width is calculated using the
formula width =FULLCOLS*px/$FFFF whereas height is calculated by the formula
height=FULLROWS*py/$FFFF.<br>

This means that if px =$8000 the print width will be $8000/$FFF,
which equals half of FULLCOLS. So the pint-out will take up half the width of the paper.</p>

<!-- section -->

<p>
For example, to dump a 100x100 section of the current screen onto a full page, retaining the
correct aspect ratio, the following line would be used:</p>

<pre>
X> Printer Dump 0,0 To 100,100,0,0,$80 Or $8 Or $4
</pre>

<p>The next example could be used for printing a low resolution screen to an eight by six inch area:</p>

<pre>
X> Printer Dump 0,0 To 320,200,8000,6000,$1 Or $2
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, part of the current screen could be dumped utilising the maximum available
height, but with the width reduced by one third, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> Printer Dump 0,0 To 200,200,$5555,0,$8 Or $10
</pre>

<p>
You are warned not to attempt to change the current screen during a screen dump operation,
otherwise the resultant print-out will become scrambled.</p>

<p><b>Other printer commands</b></p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER OUT</b><br>
<i>instruction: print data from an address</i><br>
<b>Printer Out</b> address,length</p>

<p>
This command is used to print some data directly from the memory location starting at a
specified address. The data is not processed in any way, so embedded control sequences will be
completely ignored. The PRINTER OUT instruction should be used to send simple text and
graphics only.</p>

<p>
The address parameter refers to the first character which is to be output, and length specifies the
number of characters to be printed. To send a string, the following type of line would be used:</p>

<pre>
Printer Out Varptr(A$),Len(A$)
</pre>

<p>
Similarly to PRINTER SEND, it must be ensured that data remains unchanged during the
printing process, otherwise the resultant print-out will become corrupted.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER ABORT</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop a printer operation</i><br>
<b>Printer Abort</b></p>

<p>
This command halts the current printing operation. If your printer device has a large memory
buffer, there may be a delay before the printing ceases.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER CHECK</b><br>
<i>function: return the status of the printer</i><br>
status=<b>Printer Check</b></p>

<p>
Use the PRINTER CHECK function to return a value of -1 (True) if the printer
is available for use, or zero (False) if it is in active mid-operation.</p>


<!-- section -->

<p>
<b>PRINTER ONLINE</b><br>
<i>function: report if printer is on-line</i><br>
status=<b>Printer Online</b></p>

<p>
This useful function provides a simple method of checking if the printer is connected and ready
for use. It returns a value of -1 (True) if the printer is on-line, otherwise zero (False) will be given.
This function only works with <b>parallel</b> printer devices.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER ERROR</b><br>
<i>function: check for an error in printing operation</i><br>
status=<b>Printer Error</b></p>

<p>
Use this function to check if the current printing operation is proceeding normally. A value of
zero suggests that all is well, but any other value indicates an error.</p>

<p>
<b>PRINTER BASE</b><br>
<i>function: get the address of printer base</i><br>
address=<b>Printer Base</b></p>

<p>
The PRINTER BASE function is used to return the address of the i/o structure used to control the
printer. It is intended for use by skilled operators only! Poking around the internal device
structures is a very dangerous operation indeed!</p>

<p><b>Other ports and devices</b><br>

The <b>serial</b> Port is examined in the next Chapter, and it is also possible to access the <b>parallel</b> port
directly, which provides a number of advantages over the printer device. Please refer to <a href="1038.html">Chapter
10.5</a> for full details.</p>

<p>
The complete control and exploitation of other devices that control hardware as well as internal
features of the Amiga is dealt with in <a href="11/1114.html">Chapter 11.5</a>. This Chapter ends with a general instruction
and function for dealing with ports.</p>

<p>
<b>OPEN PORT</b><br>
<i>instruction: open a channel to an 10 port</i><br>
<b>Open Port</b> channel number,"PAR:"<br>
<b>Open Port</b> channel number,"SER:"<br>
<b>Open Port</b> channel number,"PRT:"</p>

<p>
The three versions of the OPEN PORT command are shown above, and they are used to open a
channel to the Parallel Interface, or the RS232 Port, or the printer chosen in your preferences
settings. All standard sequential file commands can be performed as usual, except for commands
that are specific to disc operations, such as LOF and POF.</p>

<!-- section -->

This example would print out ten lines via the device connected to the Amiga's RS232 port:

<pre>
X> Open Port 1,"SER:"
   For X=0 To 10
    Print #1 ,"Greetings from AMOS Professional!"
   Next X
   Close 1
</pre>

<p>
<b>PORT</b><br>
<i>function: test readiness of device</i><br>
value=<b>Port</b>(channel number)</p>

<p>
The PORT function is used to test the status of readiness of the specified channel. If the device is
waiting to be read a value of -1 (True) is returned, otherwise zero (False) is given.</p>
