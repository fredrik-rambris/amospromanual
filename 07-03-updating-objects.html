    <h1>Updating Objects</h1>


    <p>
        This Chapter explains the theory behind the AMOS Professional system for updating and
        drawing moving objects. As well as a comprehensive range of commands, a completely
        automatic system is provided for your use.</p>
</section>

<section id="01-moving-multiple-objects">
    <h2>Moving multiple objects</h2>
    <p>
        As a default condition, AMOS Professional manages the position of each and every object on the
        screen automatically. The moment that the coordinates of these objects change, they are re-
        drawn almost instantly. When it comes to programming complex arcade games, that "almost
        instantly" can cause problems!</p>

    <p>
        The next two ready-made programs demonstrate a typical problem, first with Sprites and then
        with Bobs. If you examine them, you will see that the objects are moving at slightly irregular
        times, because even though AMOS Professional is updating their positions at regular intervals, it
        is not keeping pace with the FOR ... NEXT loop.</p>

    <p>
        To avoid wobbly Sprites and Bobs, all objects must be re-drawn at the same instant in your
        program, and AMOS Professional provides three commands for this purpose. SPRITE UPDATE,
        is to be used for updating Sprites, BOB UPDATE displays Blitter Objects and the UPDATE
        command re-draws both Sprites and Bobs in the same operation.</p>

    <p>
        Before calling any of these commands, the automatic updating system must be disengaged
        using the relevant command, SPRITE UPDATE OFF, BOB UPDATE OFF or UPDATE OFF, as
        appropriate. Here are two working examples to type in yourself:</p>

    <pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.Abk"
   Curs Off : Flash Off : Cls 0
   Set Sprite Buffer 256
   Hide On
   Get Sprite Palette
   Sprite Update Off
   For X=X Hard(0) To X Hard(330)
    For S=0 To 8
     Sprite S+8,X,S*25+50,2
    Next S
    Sprite Update : Wait Vbl
   Next X

E> Load "AMOSPro Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.Abk"
   Curs Off : Flash Off : Cls 0
   Double Buffer
   Get Bob Palette
   Bob Update Off
   For X=0 To 330
    For B=0 To 1
     Bob B,X,B*90,2
    Next B
    Bob Update
    Wait Vbl
   Next X
</pre>

<section id="02-displaying-objects-over-a-changing-background">
    <h2>Displaying objects over a changing background</h2>
    <p>
        When objects need to be displayed against a rapidly changing background picture, other
        problems can occur. The most important thing to understand is that although they can hold the
        same images, Sprites and Bobs are completely different from one another. The following tables
        set out these differences.</p>


    <p><b>Sprites</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>exist independently in the Amiga's memory</li>
        <li>are created by the Amiga's DMA hardware</li>
        <li>are stored independently from the screen, in a separate memory area</li>
        <li>use hardware coordinates</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Bobs</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>do not exist independently, their appearance on screen is all there is!</li>
        <li>are created by software using the Blitter chip</li>
        <li>are stored as part of the current display</li>
        <li>use screen coordinates</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This has far reaching implications for your programming, and is the crucial reason for the entire
        DOUBLE BUFFER system. It is the complete independence of Sprites that make them so useful.</p>

    <p>
        AMOS Professional allows you to use Bobs with animated screens, and the next section explains
        how screens are updated to permit this.</p>
</section>

<section id="03-the-update-process">
    <h2>The update process</h2>
    <p>
        This explanation of the Bob movement system is very detailed. If you are not interested in the
        theory, then the BOB CLEAR and BOB DRAW commands are explained later in this Chapter,
        and will be enough to allow you to proceed.</p>

    <p>
        The updating of single buffered screens will now be examined. Supposing you want to display a
        single Witter Object on the screen. The following steps need to be undertaken:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Draw up the display screen as usual.</li>
        <li>Discover the start position where the Bob is going to be displayed, and establish the
            background area underneath the Bob.
        </li>
        <li>Copy this background area to a safe location in memory.</li>
        <li>Display the Bob over the original graphics in the target area, using the appropriate image from
            the Object Bank.
        </li>
        <li>Discover the next position where the Bob is going to move.</li>
        <li>Clear the Bob from its current position, by displaying the safely copied background image at
            its original screen location.
        </li>
        <li>Examine each Bob in turn to see if it has moved since the previous update. If so, make a copy
            of the original screen image at the new coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, update by re-drawing the Bob at its new screen position.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        If you are using double buffered screens, a separate copy of the background area is created for
        each of the two screens. At the end of a display routine, the logical and physical screens are
        swapped around by the system, to ensure that these two screens are perfectly synchronised. All
        the time that the contents of an animated screen stay completely still, there can be no problems
        with updating a static image. Unfortunately, as soon as the contents of a screen changes, the
        saved sections of the previous picture will be copied straight onto the updated screen, and
        corrupt the picture. This can only be solved if all of the standard drawing commands are
        synchronised with both the physical and logical screens, and AMOS Professional achieves this
        by means of the powerful AUTOBACK system.</p>

    <p>
        AUTOBACK is extremely intelligent and completely automatic, but it can only synchronise
        graphics and text commands. If you wish to manipulate the screen directly with SCREEN COPY
        or SCROLL, you must handle the process yourself. In other words, you will have to keep the
        logical and physical screens in step with one another and perform exactly the same operations
        in both screens.</p>

    <p>
        This routine demonstrates the danger of flicking between these screens when different items are
        held in the two components of double buffering:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Double Buffer
Autoback 0
Do
 Paper 4 : Print "Hello from the first screen"
 Screen Swap : Wait Vbl
 Paper 6 : Print "Greetings from screen two"
 Screen Swap : Wait Vbl
Loop

<section id="04-the-updating-commands">
    <h2>The updating commands</h2>
    <p>
        Under normal circumstances, AMOS Professional displays all Bobs at once. So if any Bob
        coordinates are changed, that Bob can be expected to appear at its new position immediately.</p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, the Amiga's hardware is only capable of re-drawing a limited number of objects
        on screen in any single display cycle. This means that if you try and move several Bobs at once,
        it is almost inevitable that some of those objects will be re-positioned at slightly different times.
        This phenomenon generates unpleasant jerky movements. Thankfully, AMOS Professional
        provides a simple solution to this problem.</p>

    <i>instruction: move many Bobs simultaneously</i><br>
    <b>Bob Update</b><br>
    <b>Bob Update</b> Off<br>
    <b>Bob Update</b> On<br>

    <p>
        BOB UPDATE performs all Bob movements in a single, mighty burst, so all objects are moved at
        the same instant in your program. The resulting movement effects are now incredibly smooth,
        even with dozens of objects on screen at once. BOB UPDATE is extremely easy to use,
        as the following technique explains.</p>


    <ul>
        <li>First, turn off the automatic system with BOB UPDATE OFF</li>
        <li>Execute your main loop as normal.</li>
        <li>Now call a BOB UPDATE command at the point when objects are to be drawn on screen. This
            command automatically flips the results onto the display, using the internal equivalent of a
            SCREEN SWAP.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, wait for the updates to be completed, by using WAIT VBL.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        BOB UPDATE is now used as the standard technique in the vast majority of AMOS arcade
        games.</p>

    <p>
        If you need to restore the re-drawing system to its default status, BOB UPDATE ON sets the
        situation back to normal. One word of warning though, if you are already swapping the screens
        manually with SCREEN SWAP, use BOB UPDATE carefully, because it will switch between the
        logical and physical screens immediately after your Bobs have been updated. The simplest
        remedy for any problems this may cause is to use BOB CLEAR and BOB DRAW instead. These
        are explained later.</p>

    <p><b>SPRITE UPDATE</b><br>
        <i>instruction: move all Sprites at once</i><br>
        <b>Sprite Update</b><br>
        <b>Sprite Update</b> Off<br>
        <b>Sprite Update</b> On</p>

    <p>
        You may want to remind yourself of this family of commands, which are explained in <a href="07-01-hardware-sprites.html">Chapter
        7.1</a>. They parallel the BOB UPDATE commands, and are used in the same way.</p>

    <p>
        You are recommended to add a WAIT VBL instruction after each SPRITE UPDATE, to make sure
        that Sprite movements are perfectly synchronised with the existing screen display.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-update">UPDATE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move all objects at once</i><br>
        <b>Update</b><br>
        <b>Update</b> Off<br>
        <b>Update</b> On</p>

    <p>
        The UPDATE commands are a combination of the BOB UPDATE and SPRITE UPDATE families,
        and they are used to re-draw all objects on the screen in a single operation.
        UPDATE OFF turns off the automatic re-drawing system, so that any Bob or Sprite commands
        will appear to be completely ignored. In actual fact, they are still going on invisibly, in the
        background.</p>

    <p>
        UPDATE displays any objects which have moved since the last update. You are recommended
        to add a WAIT VBL instruction to ensure a smooth effect.</p>

    <p>UPDATE ON returns the updating system back to the original automatic setting.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-bob-clear">BOB CLEAR</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: clear all Bobs from the screen</i><br>
        <b>Bob Clear</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-bob-draw">BOB DRAW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: re-draw all Bobs on screen</i><br>
        <b>Bob Draw</b></p>

    <p>
        This pair of commands is used to synchronise Bob updates with complex screen movements,
        and generate superbly smooth scrolling screen effects. The technique is achieved by the
        following steps.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Remove all Bobs from the logical screen display with BOB CLEAR. Background areas are
            copied from their invisible hiding places in memory, and the display is returned to its original
            condition.
        </li>
        <li>Each Bob is now examined in turn, and checked to see if it has been repositioned. If so, the
            area beneath the new coordinates are copied invisibly, as they will be needed to return the
            screen back to normal, when the Bob is next moved. You can now perform your drawing
            operations as required, and move your Bobs to any point on the screen.
        <li>Now use BOB DRAW to re-draw any Bobs that have moved at their new screen coordinates,
            using the appropriate image from the Object Bank.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Note that BOB CLEAR and BOB DRAW will only work on the current logical screen, so if
        DOUBLE BUFFER has been activated, a SCREEN SWAP command will be needed to call the
        relevant display, as follows:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Screen Swap : Wait Vbl</code>

    <p>
        Also remember to turn off the automatic updating system completely before use. Here is the
        correct procedure.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Turn off the AUTOBACK system to stop the synchronisation between your graphics and Bobs,
            like this:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Autoback 0</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Now that all graphical operations have been forced to work with the logical screen, turn off
            the standard updating system, with BOB UPDATE OFF.
        </li>
        <li>Next add a BOB CLEAR command at the start of your main loop. You can now draw your
            graphics on screen, and move your objects as required.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, re-draw your objects at their new positions using BOB DRAW.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        If you are using double buffering, you must make sure that there is a genuine connection
        between the logical and physical screens. To achieve smooth graphics, there must be a sensible
        progression from screen to screen, otherwise flickering distortions will be displayed.</p>

    <p>
        When scrolling the playing area of a computer game, it is often possible to ensure that screens
        are already in step, so BOB CLEAR and BOB DRAW can be used without any problems. In other
        situations, you may need to make radical changes from screen to screen, so ensure that these are
        made both copies of the current screen.</p>
</section>

<section id="05-the-autoback-command">
    <h2>The Autoback command</h2>
    <p>
        The standard Bob routines only work if the logical and physical screens are in perfect harmony.
        The instant that text or graphics are drawn, or the SCREEN COPY command is used, the two
        screens fall out of step with one another, ruining any smooth effects. In the case of SCREEN
        COPY, you must take control over the system with the BOB DRAW and BOB CLEAR
        commands, but when using standard graphics commands, the situation is much easier.</p>

    <p>
        AMOS Professional includes a powerful feature that automatically synchronises all text and
        graphics operations with all Bob updates. This means that once DOUBLE BUFFER is activated,
        graphics and text can be displayed as normal. This is the principle of the AUTOBACK system.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-autoback">AUTOBACK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set mode for graphics operations on double buffered screen</i><br>
        <b>Autoback</b> mode</p>

    <p>
        There are three AUTOBACK modes, and you can toggle between them by setting the mode
        values as follows:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Autoback 0</code>

    <p>
        Manual mode. This mode deactivates the AUTOBACK system completely, so that graphics are
        drawn directly on the logical screen, for maximum speed. It is recommended for use with the
        BOB DRAW and BOB CLEAR commands.</p>

    <p>
        AUTOBACK 0 is useful when large amounts of graphics are drawn on screens being switched
        manually with SCREEN SWAP, because it is much faster than the standard system. But
        remember that you must take responsibility for synchronising between the logical and physical
        screens.</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Autoback 1</code>

    <p>
        Semi-automatic. In mode 1, AUTOBACK performs all graphical operations on both the logical
        and physical screens. Although Bob updates are not taken into account, this is an ideal mode for
        displaying hi-score tables and control panels. So as long as your Bobs are kept clear of any new
        graphics, this mode is perfect.</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Autoback 2</code>


    <p>
        <b>Fully-automatic.</b> This setting re-activates the normal AUTOBACK system. Under mode 2,
        whenever graphics are drawn on screen, they will be synchronised with any active Bobs
        automatically. All worries are taken care of by the system.</p>
</section>

<section id="06-bob-drawing-modes">
    <h2>Bob drawing modes</h2>
    <p>Once Bobs have been set up, you are allowed to change the way that they react with other
        screen graphics.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-set-bob">SET BOB</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set drawing mode for Bobs</i><br>
        <b>Set Bob</b> number,background,planes,mask</p>

    <p>
        SET BOB is used to change the drawing mode used to display a particular Blitter Object. It is
        best used <b>before</b> displaying a Bob on the screen. This command has several parameters, of
        which the first is simply the number of the Bob to be affected.</p>

    <p>
        The second parameter is a number that sets the mode of the background, in other words, the
        way that graphics underneath the Bob are to be re-drawn. There are three alternative
        background mode settings. A value of <b>zero</b> automatically replaces the screen background
        beneath the Bob, after it moves away. This is the standard drawing system, and gives a smooth
        animation effect when the Bob is moved across the screen.</p>

    <p>
        If the background is a <b>positive</b> number, then the original background graphics are completely
        forgotten when the Bob moves away, and the area beneath the Bob is replaced by a solid block
        of colour. The colour is calculated with this formula:</p>

    <p>Colour = Background-1</p>

    So the following line sets the mode of Bob 1, and draws a block of graphics in colour 9
    (calculated as 10-1) whenever the Bob is moved. Notice how commas must be included if other
    parameter values are omitted.

<code class="prefix ex">Set Bob 1,10,,</code>

    <p>
        Since this operation is much faster than the standard system, it is recommended for bursts of
        extra speed. It can be used for moving Bobs across areas such as clear blue sky, and is also
        extremely effective when operated with the various rainbow effects.</p>

    <p>
        The final alternative background setting is to use a <b>negative</b> value. This turns off the re-drawing
        process, allowing you to fill the old background areas with any colours or patterns you like,
        using the standard AMOS Professional graphics commands.</p>

    <p>
        After the two parameters that set the Bob number, and the background mode, SET BOB requires
        a parameter to establish which of the screen planes is to be used for the Bob. The planes setting
        is a bit-map, consisting of a binary number where each digit represents one plane of the screen,
        and each plane represents one bit of the final colour to be displayed on screen. The numbering
        system works like this:</p>

    <pre>
Plane: 543210
Digit: %111111
</pre>


    <p>
        By changing these planes, selected colours can be omitted from the Bob when it is drawn on
        screen. For example:</p>

    <pre>
X Set Bob 1,0,$000111 : Rem Display bits drawn in colours 0 to 7
  Set Bob 1,0,$111111 : Rem Display all bit-planes
</pre>

    <p>
        The last SET BOB parameter is another bit pattern, that selects one of 255 possible Miler modes
        used to draw Bobs on screen. This can set a mask, so that colour zero is transparent, and a full
        description of the available modes is given at the beginning of <a href="06-02-using-screens.html">Chapter 6.2</a>, in the SCREEN
        COPY section. In fact, the mask parameter is usually set to one of two values:</p>

    <p>%11100010 if no mask is to be used.</p>

    <p>%11001010 if the Bob is to be used with a mask, in other words, if colour zero is to be
        transparent.</p>

    <p>So the following line would set Bob 1 moving across the original screen colours, with a mask set:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Set Bob 1,0,%111111, %11001010</code>

    <p>Advanced users may find the following information useful:</p>

    <pre>
<b>Blitter Source     Purpose</b>
A                  Blitter Mask
B                  Blitter Object
C                  Destination Screen
