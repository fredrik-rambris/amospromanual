    <h1>Icons and Blocks</h1>


    <p>This Chapter deals with the practical handling of rectangular units of graphic images.</p>
</section>

<section id="01-background-screen-graphics">
    <h2>Background screen graphics</h2>
    <p>
        It is common for modern arcade games to feature hundreds of different background screens,
        over which the animated action takes place. Similarly, practical programs like kitchen-planners
        may need to display scores of varied settings. A fraction of these requirements would normally
        exhaust your Amiga's memory, leaving no room at all for your program!</p>

    <p>
        To overcome this restriction, backgrounds can be constructed from a set of simple graphic
        blocks, to be arranged and re-arranged as you wish, in varied patterns Each background screen
        can now be stored as a simple list of component blocks. These blocks are sometimes known as
        "tiles", and AMOS Professional provides two sets of alternative tiles: Icons, which are held in
        their own memory bank, and Blocks, which are held as temporary data.</p>


    An Icon is an individual image, specifically designed to act as a component of a background
    screen picture. All Icons are stored in their own AMOS Professional memory bank, which is
    bank 2, and this Icon Bank will be saved along with your program listing automatically.</p>

    <p>Once an Icon is drawn it has a fixed location and cannot be moved to another part of the screen.</p>

    <p>
        Icons are displayed using the Amiga's Blitter chip, which is also responsible for the display of
        Robs. However, because Icons are essentially static Objects, they are normally drawn in replace
        mode. This means that any existing graphics at the relevant screen location will be completely
        erased by the Icon.</p>

    <p>Here is a complete list of the Icon commands.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-get-icon">GET ICON</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: create an Icon</i><br>
        <b>Get Icon</b> Icon number,x1,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2<br>
        <b>Get Icon</b> screen number,lcon number,x1,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2</p>

    <p>
        The GET ICON command grabs an image from the screen and loads it into an Icon. Specify the
        Icon number, and then give the coordinates of the rectangle that is to be grabbed, from the top
        left-hand corner to the bottom right-hand corner. If the Icon whose number you specify does
        not already exist, it will be created in Bank 2. If the memory bank has not been reserved, this will
        also be done automatically.</p>

    <p>
        An optional screen number can also be given, immediately after the GET ICON instruction, and
        this will select the screen to be used as the source of the Icon's image. If this screen number is
        omitted, the image is taken from the current screen.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-get-icon-palette">GET ICON PALETTE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: load Icon colours into current screen</i><br>
        <b>Get Icon Palette</b></p>

    <p>
        This instruction is usually employed to initialise a screen, after Icons have been
        loaded from disc.</p>


    <p>
        GET ICON PALETTE grabs the colours of the Icon images stored in Bank 2, and loads them in to
        the current screen.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-paste-icon">PASTE ICON</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: draw an Icon</i><br>
        <b>Paste Icon</b> x,y,number</p>

    <p>
        Use the PASTE ICON command to draw the specified Icon number already stored in Bank 2, on
        screen. The screen position is defined by graphic coordinates, and can be anywhere you like.
        Icon images will be clipped in the normal way, if they exceed the standard limitations. Here is a
        simple example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Flash Off : Load Iff "AMOSPro_Examples:Iff/logo.iff"
Z=0
For A=0 To 304 Step 16
 Inc Z
 Get Block Z,A,1,16,199
Next A
Cls 0
For A=0 To 304 Step 16
 Put Block Z,A,0
 Dec Z
 Wait Vbl
Next A
</code>

    <p>
        If the DOUBLE BUFFER system in engaged, a copy of the Icon will be drawn into both the
        logical and physical screens, and because this takes a little time, you are advised to add a call to
        AUTOBACK 0 before drawing Icons on screen. This restricts the Icon to the current logical
        screen, and then the entire background may be copied to the physical screen, using SCREEN
        COPY, which is a much faster process.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-del-icon">DEL ICON</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: delete Icons</i><br>
        <b>Del Icon</b> number<br>
        <b>Del Icon</b> first number <b>To</b> last number</p>

    <p>
        DEL ICON erases the Icon whose number is specified from Bank 2. A second Icon number may
        also be given, in which case, all Icons from the first number TO the second number will be deleted.
        When the final Icon in the bank has been deleted, the whole bank will be removed from memory.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-ins-icon">INS ICON</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: insert a blank Icon image into the Icon bank</i><br>
        <b>Ins Icon</b> number<br>
        <b>Ins Icon</b> first To last</p>

    <p>
        The INS ICON instruction operates in exactly the same way as INS BOB, which is explained in
        <a href="07-02-blitter-objects.html">Chapter 7.2</a>.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-make-icon-mask">MAKE ICON MASK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set colour zero to transparent</i><br>
        <b>Make Icon Mask</b><br>
        <b>Make Icon Mask</b> number</p>

    <p>
        Normally, any Icons that are drawn on screen completely replace the existing background
        image, and the Icon appears in a rectangular box filled with colour zero. If you prefer to overlay
        Icons on top of the current graphics, a mask must be created. This is achieved by the MAKE
        ICON MASK command, and sets colour zero to transparent. All Icons in Bank 2 will be affected
        by this instruction, unless an optional Icon number is given, in which case only that Icon will be
        masked.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-no-icon-mask">NO ICON MASK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: remove colour zero mask from Icon</i><br>
        <b>No Icon Mask</b> number</p>

    <p>
        This command performs exactly the same task as the NO MASK instruction, explained in
        <a href="07-02-blitter-objects.html">Chapter 7.2</a>, except that it is used with Icons instead of Bobs.</p>

<section id="02-screen-blocks">
    <h2>Screen blocks</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike Icons, graphic Blocks are not saved along with your programs, and the following BLOCK
        Instructions are used to hold and manipulate temporary graphics data. Blocks are extremely
        useful for setting up items such as dialogue boxes, by saving background pictures before new
        graphics are displayed. They can be used to create "tiles" for all sorts of entertainment programs,
        such as visual puzzles, as well as practical programs like identi-kits and architectural planners.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-get-block">GET BLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: grab a screen Block into memory</i><br>
        <b>Get Block</b> number,x,y,width,height<br>
        <b>Get Block</b> number,x,y,width,height,mask</p>

    <p>
        The GET BLOCK command is used to grab a rectangular area from the graphics on the current
        screen. First specify a Block number from 1 up to 65535, then set the coordinates of the top left-
        hand corner of the rectangle to be grabbed, followed by the number of pixels making up the
        width and height of the Block.</p>

    <p>
        An optional mask code can be added after these parameters. If this code is set to zero, the Block
        will destroy and replace any graphics that used to occupy its position on screen. If the mask
        code is set to 1, the block is given a background mask, and colour zero becomes transparent.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-put-block">PUT BLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: copy Block onto screen</i><br>
        <b>Put Block</b> number<br>
        <b>Put Block</b> number,x,y<br>
        <b>Put Block</b> number,x,y,bit-planes<br>
        <b>Put Block</b> number,x,y,bit-planes,blitter mode</p>

    <p>
        To re-draw a Block at its original coordinates on the current screen, simply add
        the Block's identification number after the PUT BLOCK command.</p>


    <p>
        If you want to draw the Block at a new position, then add the new x,y-coordinates for the It
        left-hand corner, after the Block number.</p>

    <p>
        The Amiga's screen is divided into segments known as "bit-planes", and Blocks are normally
        displayed using all the available screen bit-planes, which is a bit-pattern of %111111. Re-setting
        these bit-planes can create numerous special effects, and various settings are dealt with at the
        beginning of <a href="06-02-using-screens.html">Chapter 6.2</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-del-block">DEL BLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: delete a screen Block</i><br>
        <b>Del Block</b><br>
        <b>Del Block</b> number</p>

    <p>
        To delete all new screen Blocks, the DEL BLOCK command is used. The memory these Blocks
        used is returned to the main program automatically. If you only want to get rid of a single Block,
        follow the command with that Block's identification number.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-hrev-block">HREV BLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: flip a Block horizontally</i><br>
        <b>Hrev Block</b> number</p>

    <p>This command reverses any numbered Block, by flipping it over its own horizontal axis.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-vrev-block">VREV BLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: flip a Block vertically</i><br>
        <b>Vrev Block</b> number</p>

    <p>Similarly, VREV BLOCK is used to flip a block over its own vertical axis.</p>

<section id="03-compacted-blocks">
    <h2>Compacted blocks</h2>
    <p>
        If you need reminding about the screen compaction memory-saving techniques, please refer to
        SPACK and PACK, which are fully explained at the end of <a href="06-02-using-screens.html">Chapter 6.2</a>. The compaction system
        used for the following commands is designed for speed as opposed to efficiency. They save less
        memory than SPACK and PACK, but they are a lot faster!</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-get-cblock">GET CBLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: save and compact a screen Block</i><br>
        <b>Get Cblock</b> number,x,y,width,height</p>

    <p>
        The GET CBLOCK command is used to save and compact a rectangular area of graphics from
        the screen. These Blocks are often used to grab the area underneath dialogue boxes, so that after
        the dialogue has been completed, the screen can be rapidly restored to its original state.</p>

    <p>
        Specify the Block number from 1 to 65535, followed by the x,y-coordinates of its top left-hand
        corner. Then define the Block by giving its width and height, in pixels. Note that the x-
        coordinate, and the width of the Block will be rounded to the nearest multiple of eight pixels.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-put-cblock">PUT CBLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: display a compacted Block</i><br>
        <b>Put Cblock</b> number<br>
        <b>Put Cblock</b> number,x,y</p>

    <p>
        This command places the Block whose number is specified at its original screen coordinates.
        Optional target coordinates can be added, in which case the Block will be unpacked and then
        drawn at the new position. Any new x-coordinate will also be rounded to the nearest 8-pixel
        boundary.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-del-cblock">DEL CBLOCK</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: delete compacted Blocks</i><br>
        <b>Del Cblock</b><br>
        <b>Del Cblock</b> number</p>

    <p>
        The DEL CBLOCK instruction erases all compacted Blocks from memory, unless an individual
        Block number is specified, in which case only that Block will be erased.</p>
