<h1>Icons and Blocks</h1>

<br>

<p>
If you want to draw the Block at a new position, then add the new x,y-coordinates for the It
left-hand corner, after the Block number.</p>

<p>
The Amiga's screen is divided into segments known as "bit-planes", and Blocks are normally
displayed using all the available screen bit-planes, which is a bit-pattern of %111111. Re-setting
these bit-planes can create numerous special effects, and various settings are dealt with at the
beginning of <a href="../6/614.html">Chapter 6.2</a>.</p>

<p><b>DEL BLOCK</b><br>
<i>instruction: delete a screen Block</i><br>
<b>Del Block</b><br>
<b>Del Block</b> number</p>

<p>
To delete all new screen Blocks, the DEL BLOCK command is used. The memory these Blocks
used is returned to the main program automatically. If you only want to get rid of a single Block,
follow the command with that Block's identification number.</p>

<p><b>HREV BLOCK</b><br>
<i>instruction: flip a Block horizontally</i><br>
<b>Hrev Block</b> number</p>

<p>This command reverses any numbered Block, by flipping it over its own horizontal axis.</p>

<p><b>VREV BLOCK</b><br>
<i>instruction: flip a Block vertically</i><br>
<b>Vrev Block</b> number</p>

<p>Similarly, VREV BLOCK is used to flip a block over its own vertical axis.</p>

<p><b>Compacted blocks</b><br>

If you need reminding about the screen compaction memory-saving techniques, please refer to
SPACK and PACK, which are fully explained at the end of <a href="../6/614.html">Chapter 6.2</a>. The compaction system
used for the following commands is designed for speed as opposed to efficiency. They save less
memory than SPACK and PACK, but they are a lot faster!</p>

<p><b>GET CBLOCK</b><br>
<i>instruction: save and compact a screen Block</i><br>
<b>Get Cblock</b> number,x,y,width,height</p>

<p>
The GET CBLOCK command is used to save and compact a rectangular area of graphics from
the screen. These Blocks are often used to grab the area underneath dialogue boxes, so that after
the dialogue has been completed, the screen can be rapidly restored to its original state.</p>

<p>
Specify the Block number from 1 to 65535, followed by the x,y-coordinates of its top left-hand
corner. Then define the Block by giving its width and height, in pixels. Note that the x-
coordinate, and the width of the Block will be rounded to the nearest multiple of eight pixels.</p>
