<h1>IFF Animation</h1>

<ul>
      on screen indicating the number of the frame being currently edited, and the total number of
      frames in your animation sequence. Because the background picture for your animations is
      two led as frame number one, the editing process will start with frame number two.
  <li>Modify your picture using Any of the Deluxe Paint drawing commands, and when you are
      satisfied simply move on to the next frame by triggering [Add Frame] again.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process of modifying the last frame and then adding the next frame, for as long as
      required. You can check the progress of your animated sequence by going to the
      Anim/Control] menu and clicking on [Play]. Press any key to exit from the animation.</li>
  <li>Finally, save your animation sequence onto disc with the [Save] option from the [Anim] menu.
      This animation can now be loaded directly into AMOS Professional Basic, and animated with
      the first command listed below.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Playing an IFF animation</b></p>

<p><b>IFF ANIM</b><br>
<i>instruction: play an animation file</i><br>
<b>Iff Anim</b> "filename" <b>To</b> screen number<br>
<b>Iff Anim</b> "filename" <b>To</b> screen number, times</p>

<p>
This function provides the most straightforward way of displaying a complete IFF animation
sequence directly on screen. The "filename" must refer to a valid IFF animation saved in
"compressed" (Mode 5) format. The screen number defines the screen to be created for the
animation sequence. If the requested screen number already exists, it will be replaced by the
new definition automatically. There is an optional parameter to set the number of times the
animated sequence is to be played. If this number is omitted, the animation will be played once.</p>

<p>
Remember that frame number 1 is the background screen that serves as the basis for the entire
sequence, so that your animation will always re-start from frame number 2.</p>

<p>
After the animation has been played the requested number of times it will stop. The memory
consumed will automatically be released back to AMOS Professional for re-use.</p>

<p>
If you have a disc containing an IFF animation file, place it into any drive and call up the
standard file selector, like this:</p>

<pre>
D> Iff Anim Fsel$("**") To 0,10
</pre>

<p>
When the file is requested, your animation sequence will be loaded into screen 0 and cycled
through ten times.</p>

<p><b>Direct IFF animation</b><br>
Because the standard AMOS Professional drawing commands may be used with IFF animations,
you are provided with a range of functions for loading and manipulating animated sequences
directly in your programs.</p>
