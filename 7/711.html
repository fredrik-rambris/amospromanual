<br>

<p><b>HOT SPOT</b><br>
<i>instruction: set reference point for all coordinate calculations</i><br>
<b>Hot Spot</b> image number,x,y<br>
<b>Hot Spot</b> image number,pre-set value</p>

<p>
The HOT SPOT command sets the hot spot of an image stored in the current Object Bank. The
hot spot x,y-offset is measured from the top left-hand corner of the image, and is added to those
coordinates before use, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>

<IMG height=201 alt   ="sprite at central hotspot" src="../images/711ship1.jpg" width=315 >

<p>
It is perfectly legal to position the hot spot outside of the current screen display. This can be
used for automatic conversion of all screen coordinates, as explained above, or to set up a games
sequence with Sprites appearing from off-screen.</p>

<p>
There is another version of this instruction, allowing automatic positioning of the hot spot to
any one of nine pre-set positions. These positions are shown in the following diagram, with the
central point of the Object image represented by the value $11. The value for a pre-set hot spot
at the top right-hand corner of the image is $20, for the bottom left-hand corner $02, and so on.</p>

<p><b>The Sprite Doctor</b><br>

The final part of this Chapter contains some instant diagnoses and remedies for common Sprite
illnesses!</p>

<p>
<b>Problem:</b> I can't display hardware Sprite zero. It does not want to appear.<br>
<b>Remedy:</b> Hardware Sprite zero is already allocated to the mouse pointer.
Use HIDE ON to remove the mouse pointer from the screen, and try again.</p>
