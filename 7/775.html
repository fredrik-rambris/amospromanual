<h1>Icons and Blocks</h1>

<br>

<p><b>MAKE ICON MASK</b><br>
<i>instruction: set colour zero to transparent</i><br>
<b>Make Icon Mask</b><br>
<b>Make Icon Mask</b> number</p>

<p>
Normally, any Icons that are drawn on screen completely replace the existing background
image, and the Icon appears in a rectangular box filled with colour zero. If you prefer to overlay
Icons on top of the current graphics, a mask must be created. This is achieved by the MAKE
ICON MASK command, and sets colour zero to transparent. All Icons in Bank 2 will be affected
by this instruction, unless an optional Icon number is given, in which case only that Icon will be
masked.</p>

<p><b>NO ICON MASK</b><br>
<i>instruction: remove colour zero mask from Icon</i><br>
<b>No Icon Mask</b> number</p>

<p>
This command performs exactly the same task as the NO MASK instruction, explained in
<a href="713.html">Chapter 7.2</a>, except that it is used with Icons instead of Bobs.</p>

<p><b>Screen Blocks</b><br>

Unlike Icons, graphic Blocks are not saved along with your programs, and the following BLOCK
Instructions are used to hold and manipulate temporary graphics data. Blocks are extremely
useful for setting up items such as dialogue boxes, by saving background pictures before new
graphics are displayed. They can be used to create "tiles" for all sorts of entertainment programs,
such as visual puzzles, as well as practical programs like identi-kits and architectural planners.</p>

<p><b>GET BLOCK</b><br>
<i>instruction: grab a screen Block into memory</i><br>
<b>Get Block</b> number,x,y,width,height<br>
<b>Get Block</b> number,x,y,width,height,mask</p>

<p>
The GET BLOCK command is used to grab a rectangular area from the graphics on the current
screen. First specify a Block number from 1 up to 65535, then set the coordinates of the top left-
hand corner of the rectangle to be grabbed, followed by the number of pixels making up the
width and height of the Block.</p>

<p>
An optional mask code can be added after these parameters. If this code is set to zero, the Block
will destroy and replace any graphics that used to occupy its position on screen. If the mask
code is set to 1, the block is given a background mask, and colour zero becomes transparent.</p>

<p><b>PUT BLOCK</b><br>
<i>instruction: copy Block onto screen</i><br>
<b>Put Block</b> number<br>
<b>Put Block</b> number,x,y<br>
<b>Put Block</b> number,x,y,bit-planes<br>
<b>Put Block</b> number,x,y,bit-planes,blitter mode</p>

<p>
To re-draw a Block at its original coordinates on the current screen, simply add
the Block's identification number after the PUT BLOCK command.</p>
