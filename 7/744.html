<h1>IFF Animation</h1>

<br>

<p><b>FRAME LOAD</b><br>
<i>function: load frames into memory</i><br>
frames=<b>Frame Load</b>(channel <b>To</b> bank/address)<br>
frames=<b>Frame Load</b>(channel <b>To</b> bank/address,number of frames)</p>

<p>
Use this function to load one or more IFF frames directly into memory. The parameters in
brackets are as follows:</p>

<p>
The channel number is the number of an animation file that is currently opened using the
OPEN IN command.</p>

<p>
Next, specify the memory address or bank number where the frames are to be stored. If an
address is specified, the entire file will be loaded into the chosen memory area, exactly like a
BLOAD instruction. If you give a bank number, a new memory bank will be reserved
automatically. It will hold your animation frames and be a permanent data bank in fast memory,
called "IFF". Please note that bank numbers can range from 1 to 65535. To avoid overrunning
your memory area and crashing the system, it is vital that enough space is reserved to hold the
entire animation sequence in memory. The actual storage requirements may be calculated with
the FRAME LENGTH function, which is explained later.</p>

<p>
Finally, there is an optional parameter that specifies the number of animation frames to be
loaded. If this number is omitted, only Frame 1 will be loaded, but if your request is greater than
the total number of available frames, all of the images will be grabbed in the current file, if
memory allows. This can be exploited to load entire sequences no matter what their length, by
setting this optional parameter to an overlarge number, as no error will be generated.</p>

<p>
FRAME LOAD returns the number of frames that have been successfully loaded into memory.
This value may be saved into a variable once the animation has been loaded, and made use of
when the sequence is to be played. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Rem Open animation file for reading
   Open In 1,"AMOSPro_Tutorial:Iff_Anim/AMOS.Anim"
   Rem Load all frames in current file
   Rem use overlarge value of 1000 to grab all available images to bank 10
   N=Frame Load (1 To 10,1000)
   Close
   Rem N now holds the number of actual frames
   Print "Number of frames in this file is ";N
</pre>

<p><b>FRAME LENGTH</b><br>
<i>function: return the length of frames in bytes</i><br>
size=<b>Frame Length</b>(channel)<br>
size=<b>Frame Length</b>(channel,number of frames)</p>

<p>
This function is used to calculate the precise amount of memory needed to hold the selected
frames of an IFF animation file. To find the exact size of the required data area with FRAME</p>
