<h1>Blitter Objects</h1>

<br>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk" : Rem Load Bob images from disc
   Curs Off.: Cls 0 : Rem Set up screen
   Flash Off : Get Bob Palette : Rem Grab Bob colours from image bank
   Double Buffer : Rem Engage Double Buffering
   For X=360 To -60 Step -4: Rem Move Bob across screen
    Bob 1,X,100,2 : Rem Display Bob at a new position
    Wait Vbl : Rem Wait for next vertical blank period
   Next X
   For X=-60 To 400 Step 4: Rem Flip image and move from left to right
    Bob 1,X,100,Hrev(2) : Rem Display Bob at new position
    Wait Vbl : Rem Wait 50th of second for Vbl
   Next X
</pre>

<p>
There is a hexadecimal version of this function, and the value returned by the HREV function is
in the following format:</p>

<p>$800+n</p>

<p>
Where $8000 is a "flag" telling AMOS Professional to reverse the Bob whenever it is displayed on
screen, and where n is the number of your image. This technique can be used to flip images
directly from an AMAL animation sequence.</p>

<p>Supposing your original sequence was created with this:</p>

<pre>
X> "Anim 0,(1,2)(2,2)(3,2)(4,2)"
</pre>

<p>To reverse these images, either of the following two lines could be used:</p>

<pre>
X> "Anim 0,($8000+1,2)($8000+2,2)($8000+3,2)($8000+4,2)"

X> "Anim 0,($8001,2)($8002,2)($8003,2)($8004,2)"
</pre>

<p>
When an image is reversed like this, the location of the hot spot is reversed horizontally too. So
if the hot spot was originally in the top left-hand corner, the hot spot of the HREV image will be
in the top right-hand corner: Depending on the image involved, this can have a great effect on
the way your image is displayed on screen. Be careful to position your hot spots sensibly, or
avoid any risks by setting them centrally, using the appropriate HOT SPOT command.</p>

<p><b>VREV</b><br>
<i>function: flip an image vertically</i><br>
new number=<b>Vrev</b>(image number)</p>

<p>
VREV is identical to HREV, except that it takes the specified image and turns it upside down
before displaying it on the screen. This is best used for animated objects that move vertically,
although comic effects can be achieved with cartoon characters.</p>
