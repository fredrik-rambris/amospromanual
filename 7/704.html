<h1>Hardware Sprites</h1>

<br>

<p><b>The Sprite command</b></p>

<p><b>SPRITE</b><br>
<i>instruction: display a Sprite on the screen</i><br>
<b>Sprite</b> Sprite number<br>
<b>Sprite</b> Sprite number,hx,hy,image number</p>

<p>
The SPRITE command assigns an image to a Sprite, and displays it at the selected hardware
coordinates.</p>

<p>
The Sprite number can range from 0 to 63. Normally, Sprite number zero is not available because
it is already allocated to the mouse pointer. To ensure that you have the maximum number of
Sprites at your disposal, remove the mouse pointer from the screen with HIDE ON. Sprite
identification numbers from 0 to 7 refer to the eight hardware Sprites whose limitations have
already been explained. You will probably want to make use of the AMOS Professional
computed Sprites in your programs instead, and these are assigned the numbers from 8 to 63.</p>

<p>
The hardware coordinates hx and hy set the position at which the Sprite will be displayed. Since
Sprites are totally independent from the current screen, normal screen coordinates cannot be
used for this purpose. Instead, all Sprites are positioned by special hardware coordinates as used
by the mouse pointer and the SCREEN DISPLAY command. Hardware coordinates can be
converted from normal screen coordinates by the X HARD and Y HARD functions, which are
explained later.</p>

<p>
The position of the Sprite is measured from a single spot related to that Sprite, known as the
"hot spot". This is usually taken to be the top left-hand corner of the Sprite, but it can be placed
anywhere you like using the HOT SPOT command. Hot spots are explained in detail near the
end of this Chapter.</p>

<p>
When the Sprite has been allocated an identification number and given its display coordinates,
you must select an image for the Sprite to display. Images are created using the Object Editor
(there is a guided tour of this process in <a href="../13/1308.html">Chapter 13.2</a>) and deposited in the Object Bank, which
is normally memory bank 1. Each image in this bank is assigned its own number, starting from
one. To select an image for a Sprite to display, simply give the appropriate image number. Sprite
images may be installed into your programs using the LOAD command, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Load "Sprites.Abk"
</pre>

<p>
Once images have been installed in this way they will be saved along with your AMOS
Professional programs automatically.</p>

<p>
The image number and coordinate parameters can be omitted after a SPRITE command, but the
appropriate commas must be included.</p>
