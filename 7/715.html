<h1>Blitter Objects</h1>

<br>
  <ul>
        essence, double buffering creates an invisible copy of the current screen where drawing
        operations take place, resulting in beautifully smooth movement effects.

    <li>Finally, your Bobs are assigned their individual starting positions. This could be a simple series
        of BOB commands, or a complex pattern of off-screen starting points for each level of an arcade game.</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>General Bob Commands</b></p>

<p><b>BOB OFF</b><br>
<i>instruction: remove a Bob from display</i><br>
<b>Bob Off</b><br>
<b>Bob Off</b> number</p>

<p>
Use this command to remove all Bobs from the screen simultaneously. If a Bob number is
specified, only that Bob will be extinguished. For example:</p>

<pre>
X> Bob Off 1: Rem Remove Bob1 only
   Bob Off : Rem Remove all Bobs from screen
</pre>

<p>
The BOB OFF instruction also turns off any animation or collision routines associated with these
Bobs.</p>

<p><b>X BOB</b><br>
<i>function: get x-coordinate of a Bob</i><br>
x-coordinate=<b>X Bob</b>(number)</p>

<p><b>Y BOB</b><br>
<i>function: get y-coordinate of a Bob</i><br>
y-coordinate=<b>Y Bob</b>(number)</p>

<p>
It is not difficult to keep track of Bobs under normal circumstances, but if Bobs are moved with
AMAL, their coordinates can vary unpredictably. In which case, the X BOB and Y BOB functions
may be used to get a snapshot of their current position, by returning the screen coordinates of
your selected Bob. Specify the number of the chosen Bob on screen, and the appropriate
coordinate will be returned, as measured from the top left-hand corner of the screen to the hot
spot of the current image. For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk"
   Curs Off : Cls 0: Rem Set up screen
   Flash Off : Get Bob Palette : Rem Grab Bob colours from image bank
   Double Buffer : Rem Engage double buffering
   Autoback 1: Rem Engage fast drawing mode
   Do
    Rem Move Bob1 with mouse
    Rem Convert hardware coords to screen coords
    Bob 1,X Screen(X Mouse),Y Screen(Y Mouse),1
    Rem Print new location on screen
    Locate 0,0 : Print X Bob(1);" ";Y Bob(1);" ";
   Loop
</pre>
