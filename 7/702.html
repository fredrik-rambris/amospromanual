<h1>Hardware Sprites</h1>

<p>
If this hardware Sprite is split into segments, and each segment is assigned to a separate image,
the same memory area of this single Sprite can be used to display up to 16 simultaneous images.
Fortunately, the Amiga's hardware allows each of these segments to be repositioned anywhere
on the current line, as illustrated by the next diagram.</p>

<p>
Because there are up to eight 3-colour or four 15-colour Sprites available for AMOS Professional
to commandeer and use, you are given access to dozens of objects on the screen at the same
time. However, there is still the size restriction to be overcome.</p>

<p>
By displaying two or more 16-pixel Sprites side by side, larger objects can be created, up to a
maximum width of 64 pixels for 15-colour and 128 pixels for 3-colour Sprites. Even if these width
limits are exceeded, your programs will still run, although it is highly likely that your SPRITE
command will be completely ignored!</p>

<p>
When you use a mixture of 3-colour and 15-colour Sprites on the same screen, it is much safer to
assume that the lower width limit totalling 64 pixels applies. Alternatively, the maximum total
line widths of Sprites may be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>total width = (Width of all 15-colour Sprites)*2 + (Width of all 3-colour Sprites)</p>
