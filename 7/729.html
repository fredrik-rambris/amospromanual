<h1>Updating Objects</h1>

<br>

<ul>
  <li>First, turn off the automatic system with BOB UPDATE OFF</li>
  <li>Execute your main loop as normal.</li>
  <li>Now call a BOB UPDATE command at the point when objects are to be drawn on screen. This
      command automatically flips the results onto the display, using the internal equivalent of a
      SCREEN SWAP.</li>
  <li>Finally, wait for the updates to be completed, by using WAIT VBL.</li>
</ul>

<p>
BOB UPDATE is now used as the standard technique in the vast majority of AMOS arcade
games.</p>

<p>
If you need to restore the re-drawing system to its default status, BOB UPDATE ON sets the
situation back to normal. One word of warning though, if you are already swapping the screens
manually with SCREEN SWAP, use BOB UPDATE carefully, because it will switch between the
logical and physical screens immediately after your Bobs have been updated. The simplest
remedy for any problems this may cause is to use BOB CLEAR and BOB DRAW instead. These
are explained later.</p>

<p><b>SPRITE UPDATE</b><br>
<i>instruction: move all Sprites at once</i><br>
<b>Sprite Update</b><br>
<b>Sprite Update</b> Off<br>
<b>Sprite Update</b> On</p>

<p>
You may want to remind yourself of this family of commands, which are explained in <a href="../7/701.html">Chapter
7.1</a>. They parallel the BOB UPDATE commands, and are used in the same way.</p>

<p>
You are recommended to add a WAIT VBL instruction after each SPRITE UPDATE, to make sure
that Sprite movements are perfectly synchronised with the existing screen display.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b><br>
<i>instruction: move all objects at once</i><br>
<b>Update</b><br>
<b>Update</b> Off<br>
<b>Update</b> On</p>

<p>
The UPDATE commands are a combination of the BOB UPDATE and SPRITE UPDATE families,
and they are used to re-draw all objects on the screen in a single operation.
UPDATE OFF turns off the automatic re-drawing system, so that any Bob or Sprite commands
will appear to be completely ignored. In actual fact, they are still going on invisibly, in the
background.</p>

<p>
UPDATE displays any objects which have moved since the last update. You are recommended
to add a WAIT VBL instruction to ensure a smooth effect.</p>

<p>UPDATE ON returns the updating system back to the original automatic setting.</p>
