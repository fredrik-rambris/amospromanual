<p>
This stops the Object when it reaches the specified coordinate value, which must be less than (or
equal to) the original horizontal target destination. Try changing the third line of the last
example to this:</p>

<pre>
E> Move X 1,"(1,-5,30)E100"
</pre>

<p><b>MOVE Y</b><br>
<i>instruction: move Object vertically</i><br>
<b>Move Y</b> number,"(speed,step,count) ...(speed,step,count)"<br>
<b>Move Y</b> number,"(speed,step,count) ...(speed,step,count)L"</p>

<p>
This command operates in the same way as MOVE X, and controls vertical movement. First the
number of an animation sequence is given, ranging from 0 to 15, and this sequence must be
Already allocated using the CHANNEL command. Then the movement string is given, as
explained above. Positive values for the <b>step</b> parameter control downward movements, and a
negative value will result in an upward movement. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.abk" : Get Sprite Palette
   Channel 1 To Sprite 1: Sprite 1,228,50,1: Wait Vbl
   Move Y 1,"(1,1,180)(1,-1,180)L" : Rem Loop Sprite
   Channel 2 To Screen Display 0: Rem Assign screen position
   Move Y 2,"(1,4,25)(1,-4,25)" : Rem Bounce screen up and down
   Move On : Wait Key
</pre>

<p><b>MOVE ON</b><br>
<b>MOVE OFF</b><br>
<i>instructions: toggle movements</i><br>
<b>Move On</b><br>
<b>Move On</b> number<br>
<b>Move Off</b><br>
<b>Move Off</b> number</p>

<p>
Before any movement patterns can be executed, they must be activated by a MOVE ON
command. All movements will begin at once unless an optional number is given, in which case
only that particular animation sequence will be activated. MOVE OFF has the opposite effect,
halting all animations, or a single sequence specified by its number.</p>

<p><b>MOVON</b><br>
<i>function: report movement status</i><br>
value=<b>Move On</b>(Object number)</p>

<p>
Use the MOVON function to check whether a particular Object is being moved by a MOVE X or
MOVE Y command. A value of -1 (true) is returned while the Object is in motion, otherwise zero
(false) is given for static Objects. Please note that MOVON does not search for patterns
generated by AMAL.</p>
