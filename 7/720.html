<h1>Blitter Objects</h1>

<br>

<p>
GET BOB is an extremely useful command, allowing any section of a screen to be loaded into a
Bob, and then manipulated with the AMAL system. You can even write your own object editor
from start to finish! It is also possible to create and modify Bob images from AMOS Professional
Basic. This allows, you to produce stand-alone program listings that will run without the need
for external image files. Try the next example:</p>

<pre>
E> Double Buffer : Flash Off : Curs Off
   Rem Draw an expanding circle and grab it as a Bob
   For C=1 To 15
    Ink 5 :Circle 16,16,C: Paint 16,16
    Get Bob C,0,0 To 32,32
    Cls 0,0,0 To 32,32
   Next C
   Rem Animate new Bob image
   Do
    Add IMAGE,1
    If IMAGE>15 Then IMAGE=1
    For W=0 To 4: Wait Vbl : Next W: Rem Slow down animation
    Rem Assign next image in sequence to Bob 1
    Bob 1,X Screen(X Mouse),Y Screen(Y Mouse),IMAGE
   Loop
</pre>

<p><b>PUT BOB</b><br>
<i>instruction: put a fixed copy of a Bob on screen</i><br>
<b>Put Bob</b> number</p>

<p>
The PUT BOB command takes the Bob whose number is given and fixes a permanent copy of its
image on the screen, at the current position. This is achieved by preventing the background area
beneath the Bob from being re-drawn. Note that after the image has been copied, the original
Bob can be animated and moved with no ill effects.</p>

<p>
In actual fact, PUT BOB is included as a support for STOS programmers, who wish to make their
old Atari STOS programs compatible with AMOS Professional. Because it only works with single
buffered screens, it is not particularly useful, and PASTE BOB is recommended as the preferred
command. Please see below.</p>

<p><b>PASTE BOB</b><br>
<i>instruction: draw an image from Object Bank</i><br>
<b>Paste Bob</b> x,y,image</p>

<p>
PASTE BOB takes an image held in the Object Bank, and draws it straight onto the current
screen. Unlike the PUT BOB command, the image is drawn immediately, so there is no need to
add the WAIT VBL commands before proceeding.</p>

<p>
It is important to note that the coordinates for the given image number are measured from the
top left-hand corner of the image, and take no account of the current hot spot setting!</p>
