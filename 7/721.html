<p>
PASTE BOB is just like any other graphics instruction, so it does not need a double buffered
screen. It can be used to generate a range of extremely fast graphical operations, and it is also
useful for mapping complex displays in scrolling arcade games. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Flash Off : Curs Off : Cis 0
   Rem The following Palette values go on one line
   Palette 0,$100,$200,$300,$400,$500.$600,$700,$800,
   $900,$A00,$B00,$000,$D00,$E00,$F00
   Rem Create some coloured circles for images
   For C=1 To 15
    Ink C : Circle 16,16,15 : Paint 16,16
    Get Bob C,0,0 To 32,32
   Next C
   Do
    Rem Choose a random circle and choose its position
    N=Rnd(14)+1 : X=Rnd(320) : Y=Rnd(200)
    Rem Paste image on screen at new coordinates
    Paste Bob X,Y,N
   Loop
</pre>

<b>Bob Bank Commands</b></p>

<p><b>DEL BOB</b><br>
<i>instruction: delete an image from the Object Bank</i><br>
<b>Del Bob</b> number<br>
<b>Del Bob</b> first <b>To</b> last</p>

<p>
The DEL BOB command permanently deletes one or more Bob images from the Object Bank. To
erase a single image, simply give the image number to be deleted, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Del Bob 2
</pre>

<p>
Whenever an image is deleted, all the subsequent images in the Bank are moved up one place in
the numerical order. For instance, if the Bank originally contained four images, the above
example would remove image number 2 from memory, leaving a gap between images 1 and 3.
This gap would be filled immediately, as the old image numbers 3 and 4 were shunted up one
place, to become the new image numbers 2 and 3.</p>

<p>
If more than one image is to be removed from the Bank, you can set the range from the first
image to the last after a DEL BOB command. The following example would delete Bob images
4,5,6 and 7:</p>

<pre>
X> Del Bob 4 To 7
</pre>

<p>
After the last image has been deleted from the Object Bank, the entire Bank is erased automatically.</p>
