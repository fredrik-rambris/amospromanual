<br>

<p><b>MOVE FREEZE</b><br>
<i>instruction: suspend Object movement</i><br>
<b>Move Freeze</b><br>
<b>Move Freeze</b> number</p>

<p>
This command suspends the movement of all Objects on screen. Frozen Objects may be re-
animated using the MOVE ON command. If an optional Object number is given after MOVE
FREEZE, then only that Object will be frozen.</p>

<p><b>ANIM</b><br>
<i>instruction: animate an Object</i><br>
<b>Anim</b> number"(image,delay)      (image,delay)"<br>
<b>Anim</b> number"(image,delay)      (image,delay)L"</p>

<p>
ANIM is used to take an Object through a sequence of different images, creating smooth
animation effects. These animations are performed fifty times every second, using interrupts, so
they can be executed simultaneously with AMOS Professional Basic programs. After the ANIM
command, a channel number must be given to specify the Object to be animated. Then an
animation string is given, with each operation composed of a pair of brackets holding an image
number and a delay time (in 50ths of a second). For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.abk" : Get Sprite Palette
   Channel 1 To Sprite 8: Sprite 8,200,100,1
   Anim 1,"(1,10)(2,10)(3,10)(4,10)"
   Anim On : Wait Key
</pre>

<p>
Similarly to the MOVE command, an L(loop) directive can be added to the movement string,
which will continuously repeat the animation. Try changing the third line in the last example
to this:</p>

<pre>
E> Anim 1,"(1,10)(2,10)(3,10)(4,10)L"
</pre>

<p><b>ANIM ON</b><br>
<b>ANIM OFF</b><br>
<i>instructions: toggle animations on and off</i><br>
<b>Anim On</b><br>
<b>Anim On</b> number<br>
<b>Anim Off</b><br>
<b>Anim Off</b> number</p>

<p>
To activate all animation sequences already created by an ANIM command, use ANIM ON. If ail
individual sequence is specified by number, then only that sequence will be affected. Similarly,
sequences started by ANIM ON may be turned off by the ANIM OFF command.</p>
