<h1>Hardware Sprites</h1>

<br>

<p><b>X HARD</b><br>
<i>function: convert screen x-coordinate into hardware x-coordinate</i><br>
x=<b>X Hard</b>(xcoordinate)<br>
x=<b>X Hard</b>(screen number,xcoordinate)</p>

<p><b>Y HARD</b><br>
<i>function: convert screen y-coordinate into hardware y-coordinate</i><br>
y=<b>Y Hard</b>(ycoordinate)<br>
y=<b>Y Hard</b>(screen number,ycoordinate)</p>

<p>
These functions convert screen coordinates into hardware coordinates, relative to the current
screen. As with X SCREEN and Y SCREEN, an optional screen number can be given, and
coordinates will be returned relative to that screen.</p>

<p>
With all four of the above functions, sensible values can only be returned when the relevant
screen has been fully initialised. Both the SCREEN OPEN and SCREEN DISPLAY commands
only come into effect from the next vertical blank, and the following examples demonstrate that
the correct coordinate values (in this case 128,50) are only returned after a WAIT VBL command.</p>

<pre>
E> Screen Open 0,320,255,16,Lowres
   Print X Hard(0,0); Y Hard(0,0)
</pre>

<p>Now try the correct version:</p>

<pre>
E> Screen Open 0,320,255,16,Lowres
   Wait Vbl
   Print X Hard(0,0); Y Hard(0,0)
</pre>

<p>
The default screen is initially located at hardware coordinates (128,50), and if you find the whole
business of hardware coordinates and screen coordinates tiresome, you can bypass the entire
conversion system.</p>

<p>
By setting the HOT SPOT of your Sprite images to (-128,-50), the reference point for all position
calculations is removed to the far corner of the display. Once an image has been prepared in this
way, it can be assigned to a Sprite and moved around using normal screen coordinates. For
example:</p>

<pre>
X> Hot Spot 1,-128,-50: Rem Set up hot spot
   Sprite 8,160,100,1 : Rem Sprite 8 to screen coords 160,100
</pre>

<p><b>The Hot Spot</b><br>

Whenever an image is drawn on screen using the SPRITE or BOB command, it is positioned
using an invisible reference point known as the "hot spot". This reference point is then used for
all coordinate calculations.</p>
