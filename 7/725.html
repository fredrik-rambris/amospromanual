<h1>Blitter Objects</h1>

<br>

<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Can I reverse an image for later use, without displaying it on screen?<br>
<b>Remedy:</b> Yes. PASTE BOB works perfectly with flipped images, and can be used directly with
HREV, VREV and REV. If you want to reverse an image quickly, without displaying a Bob, try
something like this:</p>

<pre>
X> Paste Bob 500,500,Vrev(1)
</pre>

<p>
Since the coordinates lie outside of the current screen area, the image is not displayed, but it is
still flipped by the PASTE BOB command.</p>

<p>
<b>Problem:</b> I want to flip my Sprites as well as my Bobs?<br>
<b>Remedy:</b> The flip functions do not work with Sprites directly, but there is no problem in
displaying a flipped Bob image as a Sprite. This line would be completely ignored:</p>

<pre>
X> Sprite 8,300,100,Hrev(5)
</pre>

<p>But the following routine will solve your problem:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.abk"
   Curs Off : Cls 0 : Flash Off : Get Sprite Palette
   Paste Bob 50,50,Vrev(5)
   Sprite 8,300,100,5
   Wait Vbl
</pre>

<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Can I check for a collision between two copies of the same image, for example,
between an original image and its own mirror-image?<br>
<b>Remedy:</b> Yes, but it is not recommended. If the image's hot spot has been centred the results
should be acceptable, but if the hot spot is asymmetrical you will generate unpredictable
problems.</p>
