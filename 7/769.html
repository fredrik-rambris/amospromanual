<h1>AMAL</h1>

<br>

<p>
Remember to call DOUBLE BUFFER during the initialisation procedure, to prevent unwanted
flickers when your Bobs are moved.</p>

<p>
The same channel can be used for STOS animations and AMAL programs, so it is easy to extend
your routines once they have been successfully converted from STOS to AMOS Professional.
The order of execution is AMAL ... MOVE X ... MOVE Y ... ANIM.</p>

<p>STOS compatibility is featured in the following ready-made demonstration program:</p>

<pre>
LD> Load "AMOSPro Tutorial:Tutorials/AMAL/AMAL_5.AMOS"
</pre>

<p>Here is the entire STOS-compatible range of commands.</p>

<p><b>MOVE X</b><br>
<i>instruction: move a Sprite horizontally</i><br>
<b>Move X</b> number,"(speed,step,count)... (speed,step,count)L"<br>
<b>Move X</b> number,"(speed,step,count)Enumber"</p>

<p>
The MOVE X command defines a list of horizontal movements to be performed on the
animation channel specified by the given number. This number can range from 0 to 15, and
refers to an animation sequence for an Object already assigned by the CHANNEL command.
The number is followed by a "movement string" containing a series of instructions which
control the speed and direction of the Object. These movement commands are enclosed by
brackets, and are entered as the following three parameters, separated by commas.</p>

<p>
The speed parameter sets a delay between each step of the movement, given in 50ths of a
second. Speed can vary from a value of 1 for very fast, all the way to 32767 for incredibly slow.
This is followed by a step value, setting the number of pixels the Object is to be moved during
each operation. A positive value moves the Object to the right, and a negative number to the
left. The apparent speed of the Object will depend on the relationship between the speed and
the step values, varying from slow and smooth, to rapid but jerky movements. A speed value of
about 10 (or -10) is recommended. The last parameter is a count value, which determines the
number of times the movement is to be repeated. Values range between 1 and 32767, with the
additional value of zero causing an indefinite repetition.</p>

<p>
It is vital to add an L (loop) instruction to the movement string after these parameters, if you
want to force a jump to the start of the string, forcing the entire sequence to be run again. Here
is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.Abk" :Get Sprite Palette
   Sprite 1,360,100,1
   Move X1,"(1,1,60)(1,-5,60)L"
   Move On
   Direct
</pre>

<p>
An alternative ending to the movement string is to use the E option, followed by the value of an
x-coordinate.</p>
