<h1>Detecting Collisions</h1>

<br>

<p><b>SPRITEBOB COL</b><br>
<i>function: test for collision between one Sprite and range of Bobs</i><br>
c=<b>Spritebob Col</b>(number)<br>
c=<b>Spritebob Col</b>(number,start <b>To</b> finish)</p>

<p>
As its name suggests, this function checks for a collision between the Sprite whose number you
specify, and one or more Blitter Objects. If the Sprite collides with a Bob, a value of -1 (true) is
returned, otherwise 0 (false) is given.</p>

<p>
This function will test for collisions with all Bobs on screen, but the checking process can be
restricted with the optional setting of the range of Bobs to be monitored, from the first Bob
number to the last in the range. If you need to test for collisions between several Sprites and
Bobs, the command should be enclosed in a loop, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> For FIRSTSPRITE=1 To LASTSPRITE
    If Spritebob Col(FIRSTSPRITE,FIRSTBOB To LASTBOB) Then Boom
   Next FIRSTSPRITE
</pre>

<p>
Remember that all specified Sprites must be assigned to a <b>masked</b> image, before collision
detection can work. You are also warned that this function will only work with <b>low resolution</b>
screens, and attempts to use it in high resolution will lead to unpredictable results. This is
because your Sprites and Bobs are likely to have different sized screen points.</p>

<p><b>BOBSPRITE COL</b><br>
<i>function: test for collision between one Bob and range of Sprites</i><br>
c=<b>Bobsprite Col</b>(number)<br>
c=<b>Bobsprite Col</b>(number,first <b>To</b> last)</p>

<p>
This function checks for a collision between the single Bob whose number you specify, and all
active Sprites on screen. The result will be -1 (true) is a collision is detected, or 0 (false) if the
object remains untouched. To narrow the range of Sprites to be monitored, simply include the
first to the last number in that range. As with SPRITEBOB COL, this function should only be
used in low resolution.</p>

<p><b>COL</b><br>
<i>function: test status of an object after collision detection</i><br>
status=<b>Col</b>(number)</p>

<p>
One obvious problem with all of the previous detection functions is that they only report on
whether an individual object has been hit. To discover information about any other objects
involved in a collision, the COL function is used. This means that each object can be tested on its
own, to see if it has collided with the source object.</p>

<p>
Give the number of the object you wish to test, either a Bob or a Sprite, depending on the
circumstances, and its status will be reported with a value of -1 (true) 
if it has collided, or 0 (false) if it remains untouched.</p>
