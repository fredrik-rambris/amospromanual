<h1>Updating Objects</h1>

<br>

<p>
If you are using double buffered screens, a separate copy of the background area is created for
each of the two screens. At the end of a display routine, the logical and physical screens are
swapped around by the system, to ensure that these two screens are perfectly synchronised. All
the time that the contents of an animated screen stay completely still, there can be no problems
with updating a static image. Unfortunately, as soon as the contents of a screen changes, the
saved sections of the previous picture will be copied straight onto the updated screen, and
corrupt the picture. This can only be solved if all of the standard drawing commands are
synchronised with both the physical and logical screens, and AMOS Professional achieves this
by means of the powerful AUTOBACK system.</p>

<p>
AUTOBACK is extremely intelligent and completely automatic, but it can only synchronise
graphics and text commands. If you wish to manipulate the screen directly with SCREEN COPY
or SCROLL, you must handle the process yourself. In other words, you will have to keep the
logical and physical screens in step with one another and perform exactly the same operations
in both screens.</p>

<p>
This routine demonstrates the danger of flicking between these screens when different items are
held in the two components of double buffering:</p>

<pre>
E> Double Buffer
   Autoback 0
   Do
    Paper 4 : Print "Hello from the first screen"
    Screen Swap : Wait Vbl
    Paper 6 : Print "Greetings from screen two"
    Screen Swap : Wait Vbl
   Loop
</pre>

<p><b>The updating commands</b><br>

Under normal circumstances, AMOS Professional displays all Bobs at once. So if any Bob
coordinates are changed, that Bob can be expected to appear at its new position immediately.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the Amiga's hardware is only capable of re-drawing a limited number of objects
on screen in any single display cycle. This means that if you try and move several Bobs at once,
it is almost inevitable that some of those objects will be re-positioned at slightly different times.
This phenomenon generates unpleasant jerky movements. Thankfully, AMOS Professional
provides a simple solution to this problem.</p>

<p><b>BOB UPDATE</b><br>
<i>instruction: move many Bobs simultaneously</i><br>
<b>Bob Update</b><br>
<b>Bob Update</b> Off<br>
<b>Bob Update</b> On<br>

<p>
BOB UPDATE performs all Bob movements in a single, mighty burst, so all objects are moved at
the same instant in your program. The resulting movement effects are now incredibly smooth,
even with dozens of objects on screen at once. BOB UPDATE is extremely easy to use,
as the following technique explains.</p>
