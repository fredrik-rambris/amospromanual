<h1>Blitter Objects</h1>

<br>

<p><b>INS BOB</b><br>
<i>instruction: insert a blank Bob image into the Object bank</i><br>
<b>Ins Bob</b> number<br>
<b>Ins Bob</b> first <b>To</b> last</p>

<p>
INS BOB inserts a blank image at the numbered position in the current Object Bank. All of the
images after this numbered position will then be moved down one place in the numerical order.
The second version of this command allows you to create several spaces in a single operation, by
giving the range of new gaps between the first and last image numbers that you specify.</p>

<p>
Any of these new image spaces are completely empty, and so cannot be allocated to a Bob or
displayed directly on screen while they are still blank. An actual image must first be grabbed
into the Object Bank, using a GET SPRITE or GET BOB command. If this is not done, the
appropriate error message will be given as soon as you try to access the empty image.</p>

<p>
Both DEL BOB and INS BOB are provided to be used with the GET BOB and GET SPRITE
commands. They allow you to modify and adjust your Bob images from inside AMOS
Professional programs, with complete freedom. They may be used to create numerous special
effects such as interactive screen animations and animated brushes, as used in Deluxe Paint.</p>

<p><b>Flipping Bob Images</b><br>

AMOS Professional is designed to meet every programming need when it comes to animating
images. You will often need to animate mechanical objects and cartoon characters as realistically
as possible, so every movement sequence must be created from a number of images, and each
image in the sequence must be carefully drawn using the Object Editor, ready for smooth
animation with AMAL.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, perfectly animated sequences need a great many images, which take up a great
deal of memory. To move the animated character in several directions makes the problem much
worse, because each direction needs a separate sequence of images.</p>

<p>
AMOS Professional cuts such waste of memory to a minimum. This is achieved by allowing you
to display the same image in different orientations, so that a character can be mirrored and
turned upside down, simply by flipping its image.</p>

<p><b>HREV</b><br>
<i>function: flip an image horizontally</i><br>
new number=<b>Hrev</b>(image number)</p>

<p>
This function reverses an image from left to right, creating a mirror image. Use HREV by
specifying the existing image number (in brackets) to be flipped horizontally, in order to create a
new identification number for the reversed image. This new image number can be freely used
with any of the standard Bob commands.</p>
