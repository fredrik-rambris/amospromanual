<h1>Icons and Blocks</h1>

<br>

<p>
GET ICON PALETTE grabs the colours of the Icon images stored in Bank 2, and loads them in to
the current screen.</p>

<p><b>PASTE ICON</b><br>
<i>instruction: draw an Icon</i><br>
<b>Paste Icon</b> x,y,number</p>

<p>
Use the PASTE ICON command to draw the specified Icon number already stored in Bank 2, on
screen. The screen position is defined by graphic coordinates, and can be anywhere you like.
Icon images will be clipped in the normal way, if they exceed the standard limitations. Here is a
simple example:</p>

<pre>
E> Flash Off : Load Iff "AMOSPro_Examples:Iff/logo.iff"
   Z=0
   For A=0 To 304 Step 16
    Inc Z
    Get Block Z,A,1,16,199
   Next A
   Cls 0
   For A=0 To 304 Step 16
    Put Block Z,A,0
    Dec Z
    Wait Vbl
   Next A
</pre>

<p>
If the DOUBLE BUFFER system in engaged, a copy of the Icon will be drawn into both the
logical and physical screens, and because this takes a little time, you are advised to add a call to
AUTOBACK 0 before drawing Icons on screen. This restricts the Icon to the current logical
screen, and then the entire background may be copied to the physical screen, using SCREEN
COPY, which is a much faster process.</p>

<p><b>DEL ICON</b><br>
<i>instruction: delete Icons</i><br>
<b>Del Icon</b> number<br>
<b>Del Icon</b> first number <b>To</b> last number</p>

<p>
DEL ICON erases the Icon whose number is specified from Bank 2. A second Icon number may
also be given, in which case, all Icons from the first number TO the second number will be deleted.
When the final Icon in the bank has been deleted, the whole bank will be removed from memory.</p>

<p><b>INS ICON</b><br>
<i>instruction: insert a blank Icon image into the Icon bank</i><br>
<b>Ins Icon</b> number<br>
<b>Ins Icon</b> first To last</p>

<p>
The INS ICON instruction operates in exactly the same way as INS BOB, which is explained in
<a href="713.html">Chapter 7.2</a>.</p>
