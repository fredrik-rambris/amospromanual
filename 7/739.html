<h1>Detecting Collisions</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Collisions with rectangular blocks</b><br>

The last part of this Chapter explains how rapid checks can be made to see if an Object has
entered a rectangular area of the screen. These screen "zones" can be used for collision
detection in computer games, as well as for setting up buttons, control panels and dialogue
boxes.</p>

<p><b>RESERVE ZONE</b><br>
<i>instruction: RESERVE memory for a detection zone</i><br>
<b>Reserve Zone</b><br>
<b>Reserve Zone</b> number</p>

<p>
The RESERVE ZONE instruction must be used to allocate enough memory for the exact number
of zones required, before a SET ZONE command is given. There is no limit to the number that
can be specified, apart from the amount of available memory.</p>

<p>
To erase all current zone definitions and restore the allocated memory to the main program,
simply give the RESERVE ZONE command without any number parameter.</p>

<p><b>SET ZONE</b><br>
<i>instruction: set a screen zone for testing</i><br>
<b>Set Zone</b> number,x1 ,y1 <b>To</b> x2,y2</p>

<p>
After memory has been allocated with the RESERVE ZONE command, SET ZONE is used to
define a rectangular area of the screen which can be tested by the various ZONE functions. The
command is followed by the number of the new zone, followed by its coordinates from top left
to bottom right-hand corner.</p>

<p><b>ZONE</b><br>
<i>function: return the zone number under specified screen coordinates</i><br>
number=<b>Zone</b>(x,y)<br>
number=<b>Zone</b>(screen number,x,y)</p>

<p>
The ZONE function is used to give the number of the screen zone at the specified screen
coordinates x,y. These coordinates are normally relative to the current screen, but an optional
screen number can be included before the coordinates.</p>

<p>
After the ZONE function has been called, the number of the <b>first</b> zone at these coordinates will
be returned, or a value of zero (False) will be given if no zone is detected.</p>

<p>
This function can be used with the X BOB and Y BOB functions to detect whether or not a Bob
has entered a specific screen zone, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> N=Zone(X Bob(n),Y Bob(n))
