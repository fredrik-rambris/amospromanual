<h1>AMAL</h1>

<br>

<p>
If an optional number is given, then only that AMAL routine will be activated. Similarly, AMAL
OFF stops all AMAL programs from executing, by erasing them from memory. They can only be
re-activated by using the AMAL command again. By specifying an individual AMAL program
number, only that program is stopped.</p>

<p><b>AMAL FREEZE</b><br>
<i>instruction: suspend AMAL programs</i><br>
<b>Amal Freeze</b><br>
<b>Amal Freeze</b> number</p>

<p>
Use this command to temporarily freeze one or all AMAL programs from running. These
programs may be started again at any time with an AMAL ON command. Please note that
AMAL FREEZE should be used to suspend AMAL before a command such as DIR is executed,
otherwise timing problems may happen.</p>

<p><b>AMREG</b><br>
<i>reserved variable: give value of AMAL register</i><br>
register=<b>Amreg</b>(number)<br>
register=<b>Amreg</b>(channel,number)<br>
<b>Amreg</b>(number)=expression<br>
<b>Amreg</b>(channel,number)=expression</p>

<p>
The AMREG function allows you to gain access to the contents of internal and external
AMAL registers, from inside your AMOS Professional program. An AMAL register number
must be specified, ranging from 0 to 25, with zero representing external register RA, up to 25
representing register RZ. An optional channel parameter can be given, where a specified
number from 0 to 9 is used to represent the AMAL internal registers from RU to R9.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates how the position of an AMAL Sprite can be returned:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.abk" : Get Sprite Palette
   Channel 1 To Sprite 8 : Sprite 8,100,100,1
   A$="Loop : Let RX=X+1 Let X=RX ; Pause ; Jump Loop"
   Amal 1,A$ : Amal On : Curs Off
   Do
    Locate 0,0
    Z=Asc("X")-65
    Print Amreg(Asc("X")-65) : Rem Use Asc to get register number
   Loop
</pre>

<p><b>AMPLAY</b><br>
<i>instruction: control animation produced by PLay</i><br>
<b>Amplay</b> speed, direction<br>
<b>Amplay</b> speed,direction start <b>To</b> end</p>

<p>Movement sequences that have been produced using the PLay command are controlled</p>
