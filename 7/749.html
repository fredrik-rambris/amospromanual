<h1>AMAL</h1>

<br>

<p>
Individual AMAL instructions can be separated from one another by almost any of the unused
characters, including spaces. <b>But colons cannot be used</b> for this purpose. You are recommended
to use the semi-colon character ";" instead, like this:</p>

<pre>
X> "Move ; Pause ; Jump"
</pre>

<p>
There is a choice between two ways of creating AMAL programs. One way is to define you
animations from inside AMOS Professional Basic using strings, for which a special AMAL
command is provided. The alternative method is to produce animation sequences with the
AMAL accessory program, and save them into a memory bank.</p>

<p>
The next part of this Chapter is a step-by-step guide through the basic principles of AMAL, and
is intended as an introductory tutorial. This is followed by a full list of all the AMAL commands,
along with detailed explanations of their use. Then advanced techniques will be dealt with. At
the end of the Chapter, problems with AMAL errors are solved, followed by a final section that
provides full compatibility for STOS programmers.</p>

<p><b>The AMAL guided tour</b><br>

In this section, Sprites will be used to demonstrate the wonders of AMAL. All of these
techniques work equally well with Bobs, so you can take full advantage of both types of Object
in your AMAL programs.</p>

<p><b>Moving an Object</b></p>

<p><b>MOVE</b><br>
<i>AMAL instruction: move an Object</i><br>
<b>Move</b> horizontal number,vertical number,step</p>

<p>
The M command moves an Object by a specified number of units horizontally and vertically, in
exactly the number of steps you select. Positive values will move the Object to the right and
downwards, while negative values control movement to the left of the screen and upwards.
Remember, as with most AMAL commands, this instruction is recognised by a single capital
letter, so if it is entered as "Move" or a similar single word beginning with the letter M, all of the
lower case letters will be completely ignored. To demonstrate Move, first place a Sprite on screen
at coordinates 100,100 with this:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro Tutorial:Objects/Sprites.abk" : Get Sprite Palette
   Sprite 8,200,100,1
</pre>

<p>
The range, direction and speed of how the Sprite will move now depends on the three chosen
values given after the Move command. The size of the steps will particularly affect the Sprite's
movement, with a large number of steps for a large distance resulting in very slow, very smooth
movements, and very few steps giving jerky movements. Add the following lines to the last
example:</p>

<pre>
E> Amal 8, "M 100,100,50" : Amal On 8 : Wait Key : Rem Slow diagonal movement
</pre>
