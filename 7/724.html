<h1>Blitter Objects</h1>

<br>

<p>
As with HREV, there is an equivalent hexadecimal version of the VREV function, which can be
used with AMAL animation strings. The format is:</p>

<p>$4000+n</p>

<p>
Where $4000 acts as the reversal flag, and n is the image number. Here are two typical AMAL
string of reversed animation:</p>

<pre>
X> "Anim 0,($4000+1,2)($4000+2,2)($4000+3,2)($4000+4,2)"

X> "Anim 0,($4001,2)($4002,2)($4003,2)($4004,2)"
</pre>

<p><b>REV</b><br>
<i>function: double-flip an image vertically and horizontally</i><br>
new number=<b>Rev</b>(image number)</p>

<p>
REV combines HREV and VREV into a single function. It takes the image whose number is held
in brackets, reverses it from left to right and then performs another reversal from top to bottom.
For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.abk"
   Curs Off : Cls 0
   Flash Off : Get Bob Palette
   Double Buffer
   For Y=200 To -40 Step -1
    Bob 1,Y*2,Y,1
    Wait Vbl
   Next Y
  For Y=-40 To 200
   Bob 1,Y*2,Y,Rev(1)
   Wait Vbl
  Next Y
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget to try the HELP programs for a demonstration. If your own attempts at flipping
Bob images cause any problems, you may wish to consult the Bob Doctor, below.</p>

<p><b>The Bob Doctor</b><br>

Here are some free consultations which answer common problems encountered when flipping
Bobs.</p>

<p>
<b>Problem:</b> When I use flipped Bobs on screen with their original images, my display slows down
to a crawl.<br>
<b>Remedy</b>: Do not display the same image in different orientations on screen at the same time.
AMOS Professional flips images during the updating process, just before Bobs are re-drawn on
screen. Once reversed, images stay in this new state until displayed in a different direction.
Whenever AMOS Professional flips a reversed image, it first needs to restore the image to its
original state. This takes a great deal of processor time, and slows down your display.</p>
