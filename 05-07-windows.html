    <h1>Windows</h1>

    <p>
        The AMOS Professional programmer expects to be able to produce file selectors, warning boxes
        and on-screen control panels with a few simple lines of code. The range of windowing
        command featured in this Chapter allow you to create interactive dialogue boxes by restricting
        text and graphics operations to selected areas of the current screen.</p>

    <p>
        A "window" is simply a rectangular display area, which must first be opened before electronic
        life can course through it. Your current screen is treated as a window, and opened automatically
        by the AMOS Professional system as window number zero. All other windows have to be
        opened by you, and you are advised not to re-open window zero or change its size or position.</p>
</section>

<section id="01-creating-windows">
    <h2>Creating windows</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-wind-open">WIND OPEN</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: create a window</i><br>
        <b>Wind Open</b> number,x,y,width,height<br>
        <b>Wind Open</b> number,x,y,width,height,border</p>

    <p>
        The window opened by this instruction will be displayed on screen and used for all subsequent
        text operation until you command otherwise. WIND OPEN must be qualified by a window
        number (don't forget that zero has already been allocated to the current screen), followed by the
        x,y graphic coordinates setting the top left-hand corner of the new window, followed by the
        width and height of the new window in the number of characters needed. You may also specify
        an optional border style, with values ranging from 1 to 16.</p>

    <p>
        Because the Amiga employs its blitter to draw windows, they must always lie on a 16-pixel
        boundary. AMOS Professional automatically rounds your x-coordinates to the nearest multiple
        of 16. Additionally, if you have specified a border for your window, the x and y-coordinates will
        be incremented by an additional 8 pixels. In this way, you can be sure that your windows
        always start at the correct screen boundary. There are no boundary restrictions on the y-
        coordinates. Titles can also be included in window borders, which will be dealt with a little later.
        Try this example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">For W=1 To 3
 Wind Open W,(W-1)*96,50,10,15,W
 Paper W+3 : Pen W+6 : Clw
 Print "Window";W
Next W
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-window">WINDOW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: change the current window</i><br>
        <b>Window</b> number</p>

    <p>This command sets the window number specified as the active window, to be used for all future
        text operations. There is an automatic saving system for re-drawing the contents of windows,
        which is explained below.</p>

    For now, run the last example from Direct mode and enter the following statements:

<code class="prefix direct">Window 1: Print "AMOS"
D> Window 3: Print "open windows on the world"
D> Window 2: "lets me"
</code>

    <p>The active window is host to the flashing text cursor, unless it has been made invisible with a
        CURS OFF command.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-border">BORDER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: change window border</i><br>
        <b>Border</b> number,paper, pen</p>

    <p>This command allows you to change the style and colour of the current window border. Border
        style numbers range from 1 to 16, and the paper and pen colours can be selected from any
        available colour index numbers. Any of these parameters can be omitted from the BORDER
        instruction as long as the commas are included for any missing values: If the last example is still
        on screen, enter these lines from direct mode:</p>

<code class="prefix direct">Border 3,2,3
D> Border 2,,
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-title-top">TITLE TOP</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set title at top of current window</i><br>
        <b>Title Top</b> title$</p>

    <p>Use this command to set a border title at the top of the current window to your chosen title
        string. This facility will only operate with bordered windows, as follows:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls: Wind Open 4,1,1,20,10,1
Title Top "Top of the morning"
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-title-bottom">TITLE BOTTOM</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set title at bottom of current window</i><br>
        <b>Title Bottom</b> title$</p>

    <p>Similarly, this instruction assigns a string to the bottom title of the current window, like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls : Wind Open 5,75,50,24,15
Border 5,6,
Title Bottom "Bottom of the barrel"
</code>
</section>

<section id="02-manipulating-windows">
    <h2>Manipulating windows</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-windon">WINDON</h3>
    <p><i>function: return the value of the current window</i><br>
        w=<b>Windon</b></p>

    <p>Before using windows in your programs, you will need to refer to their identification numbers.
        This function returns the value of the current window. For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Do
 Cls : Wind Open Rnd(99)+1,1,1,25,5,1
 Print "Window number ";Windon : Wait Key
Loop
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-wind-save">WIND SAVE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: save the contents of the current window</i><br>
        <b>Wind Save</b></p>

    <p>
        This command is extremely valuable for the AMOS Professional programmer. Once activated,
        the WIND SAVE feature allows you to move your windows anywhere on screen without
        corrupting the existing display, by the following method. The contents of the current window is
        saved as soon as the command is used, and then every time a new window is opened, the
        contents of the windows underneath get saved automatically. The screen is then re-drawn
        whenever a window is moved to a new position or closed.</p>

    <p>
        As you begin a new program, the current window (the default screen) consumes 32k of valuable
        memory, and this would be wasted if you were to save it as background beneath a small
        dialogue box. To solve this problem, create a dummy window of the size you need, and place it
        over the zone you want to save. Now execute your WIND SAVE command and continue with
        your program. When this dialogue box is called up, the area beneath it will be saved as part of
        your dummy window, so it will automatically be restored after your box has been removed.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-wind-close">WIND CLOSE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: close the current window</i><br>
        <b>Wind Close</b></p>

    <p>
        The WIND CLOSE command deletes the current window. If the WIND SAVE command has
        been activated, the deleted window will be replaced by the saved graphics, otherwise the area
        will be totally erased from the screen. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Wind Open 1,1,8,35,18,1 : Print "Press a key to close this window"
Wait Key
Wind Close
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-wind-move">WIND MOVE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: move the current window</i><br>
        <b>Wind Move</b> x,y</p>

    <p>
        The current window can 'be moved to any acceptable graphic coordinates. Give the new x,y-
        coordinates after the WIND MOVE command, and the x-coordinate will be rounded to the
        nearest 16-pixel boundary automatically. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Wind Save : Wind Open 1,0,2,30,10,1 : Wind Save
For M=1 To 100
 Pen Rnd(15) : Paper Rnd(15) : Print : Centre "Making Movies"
  Wind Move Rnd(30)+1,Rnd(100)+1
  Wait VbI
Next M
</code>

    <p>
        <b>SCROLL ON/OFF</b><br>
        <i>instructions: toggle window scrolling on and off</i><br>
        <b>Scroll On</b><br>
        <b>Scroll Off</b></p>

    <p>
        The SCROLL commands are used to control the scrolling of the current window. SCROLL OFF
        turns off the scrolling, and whenever the cursor passes beyond the bottom of the window it will
        reappear from the top. SCROLL ON starts the scrolling process again, so that a new line is
        inserted when the cursor tries to pass beyond the bottom of the window.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-wind-size">WIND SIZE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: change the size of the current window</i><br>
        <b>Wind Size</b> width, height</p>

    <p>
        To change the size of the current window, specify the new width and new height in terms of the
        number of characters. If WIND SAVE has been activated, the original contents of the window
        will be re-drawn by this instruction. If the new window size is smaller than the original, any
        parts of the original image that lie outside of the new window boundaries will be lost.
        Alternatively, if the new window is larger, the space around the saved area will be filled with
        the current paper colour. Please note that the text cursor is always re-set to coordinates 0,0.
        For example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Wind Open 1,16,16,22,10,2
Print "I want to be wider!"
Wind Save
Wait 50
Wind Size 30,10
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-clw">CLW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: clear the current window</i><br>
        <b>Clw</b></p>

    <p>This simple command erases the contents of the current window and replaces it with a block of
        the current PAPER colour.</p>

    <p>Like this:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Cls: Paper 4 : Wind Open 1,1,1,12,5,1
Window 1: Print "Clear Off" : Wait 75
Paper 9 : Clw

<section id="03-creating-slider-bars">
    <h2>Creating slider bars</h2>

    <p>One of the standard uses of windows is to create interactive slider bars, like the one at the right-
        hand side of your AMOS Professional Edit Screen.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-hslider">HSLIDER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: draw a horizontal slider bar</i><br>
        <b>Hslider</b> x1 ,y1 To x2,y2, units, position, length</p>

    <p>
        Horizontal slider bars are set up by giving the HSLIDER command, qualified by the following
        parameters: the x,y-coordinates of the top left-hand corner of the bar in pixels followed by the
        x,y-coordinates of the bottom right-hand corner, then the number of individual units that the
        slider is divided into. Next, you must specify the position of the active slider box or control
        button from the left-hand end of the slider, measured in the same sized units as the slider
        divisions. Finally, give the length of the slider control box in these units. The size of each unit is
        calculated with this formula:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Hslider 10,10 To 100,20,100,20,5
Hslider 10,50 To 150,100,25,10,10
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-vslider">VSLIDER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: draw a vertical slider</i><br>
        <b>Vslider</b> x1 ,y1 To x2,y2,units,position,length</p>

    <p>This works in the same way as Hslider, and sets up vertical slider bars. For a working
        demonstration, examine the vertical slider in the Editor window, where the number of units into
        which the slider is divided is set to the number of lines in the current program.</p>

    <p>Here is a simpler example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Vslider 10,10 To 20,100,100,20,5
Vslider 250,0 To 319,199,10,2,6
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-set-slider">SET SLIDER</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set fill pattern for slider bar</i><br>
        <b>Set Slider</b> ink1,paper1,outline1,pattern1,ink2,paper2,outline2,pattern2</p>

    <p>SET SLIDER is used to set up the colours and patterns used for your slider bars and their
        control boxes.</p>

    <p>Simply give the index numbers of the ink, paper, outline and pattern to be used for the slider
        bar, followed by the ink paper, outline and pattern to be used by the slider control box. If
        negative values are used for either pattern, a sprite image will be commandeered from the sprite
        bank, allowing even more spectacular effects. Try this example:</p>

<code class="prefix edit">Centre "&lt;Press a key&gt;" : Curs Off
 Do
  A1=Rnd(15) : B1=Rnd(15) : C1=Rnd(15) : D1=Rnd(24)
  A2=Rnd(15) : B2=Rnd(15) : C2=Rnd(15) : D2=Rnd(24)
  Set Slider Al ,B1,C1,D1,A2,B2,C2,D2
  Hslider 10,10 To 300,60,100,20,25
  Vslider 10,60 To 20,190,100,20,25
  Wait Key
 Loop
</code>

    <p>Having set up your slider bars, you will want to activate them using the mouse. A simple routine
        to create working slider bars needs to be included in your main program. As always, remember
        to test out the ready-made example programs, for a working guide.</p>

<section id="04-displaying-a-text-window">
    <h2>Displaying a text window</h2>

    <p>To end this Chapter, here is an extremely useful AMOS Professional feature that allows the
        display of a text file directly on screen. Text can be displayed in its own independent screen, it
        may be scrolled through at will, the display window can be dragged around the screen and
        there is even a facility to include a title line.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-read-text-dollar">READ TEXT$</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: display a text window on screen</i><br>
        <b>Read Text$</b> name$<br>
        <b>Read Text$</b> name$,address, length</p>

    <p>
        In its simplest form, the READ TEXT$ command reads the text held in a specified filename on
        disc, for example:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Read Text$ Fsel$("**")</code>

    <p>
        You can move through the displayed text using scroll bars, the arrow icons or via the following
        key combinations:</p>

    <pre>
<b>Key Press                       Effect</b>
[Up Arrow]/[Down Arrow]         Move up/down by one line
[Shift]+[Up Arrow]/[Down Arrow] Scroll up/down by one page
[Ctrl]+[Up Arrow]/[Down Arrow]  Jump directly to top/bottom of text
[Esc] or [Return]               Exit
</pre>

    <p>To read some text from an address in memory, there is an alternative version of the READ
        TEXT$ command. In this case the name$ parameter refers to a <b>title</b> line that will be printed at
        the top of the viewing window. Address holds the address of the first line of the text to be read.
        Length specifies the length of the text to be read, in bytes.</p>
