<h1>Installing Amos Professional</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Step Three</b><br>

This is the Registration Screen, asking you to type in your first name
and last name, then click on the [OK] panel with the mouse.<p>

<p>In this User Guide, whenever an option is referred to that
appears on the screen, waiting to be
selected, it is enclosed in square brackets on the printed page.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake when typing, you may insert your first
or last name again, and when both
names are entered correctly, trigger the [OK] button.</p>


<p>If for some reason this operation is unsuccessful, a screen
will appear advising you what to do.
Please make sure that you are using your <b>original</b> AMOS Professional
System Disc, and that it is
write-enabled before proceeding. If all else fails, and your disc drive
is opera ling correctly, and if the disc in the drive is the original
write-enabled System disc, then there must be a fault on the disc.
Please return it for a free re-duplication to:</p>


<p><b>AMOS Professional Customer Support</b><br>

Europress Software Ltd.<br>
Europa House<br>

<p>Fortunately, you are very unlikely to encounter a faulty disc,
and there should be no problems
in having your name accepted before proceeding to the next step.</p>


<p><b>Step Four</b><br>

your unique Registration Number. Write down this number <b>now</b>, and also
copy your Registration Number onto the following items:</p>

  <li>Your AMOS Professional Registration Card. Please return this card to

before doing so.</li>
