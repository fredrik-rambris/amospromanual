<h1>Installing Amos Professional</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Step Five</b><br>

This is the Installation Screen, and your System Disc will now
boot directly into AMOS
Professional. If you want to boot from floppy disc, press [Ctrl]+[Left Amiga]+[Right Amiga]
now. Hard disc users should continue as explained below.</p>

<p>In this User Guide, whenever you are asked to press a
particular key, the key is enclosed in
square brackets on the printed page. When two or more keys should be
pressed at the same
time, a plus sign is used to link the individual keys together. So to
boot AMOS Professional from
floppy disc now, you are asked to press the control key at the same
time as both of the special
Amiga keys that are either side of the space bar on your keyboard, or
[Ctrl]+[Left Amiga]+[Right Amiga].</p>

<p>Now is the time to fill in your Registration Numbers and <b>back
up your original AMOS Professional discs</b>. Making copies of discs is very simple,
using the AMOS Professional Disc
Manager utility, which is fully explained in Chapter 13.4.</p>

<p><b>Hard Disc Users</b><br>

With the Installation Screen still displayed, hard disc users
should click on the [OK] panel. The
start-up sequence is changed from running the Installer to running AMOS
Professional, but the
Installer can be recalled by double-clicking on its Workbench icon.</p>

<p><b>Step Six</b><br>

Hard Disc Users are taken to the AMOS Professional Hard Disc
Installation Screen. When this
appears, simply indicate which items you would like installed onto your
hard disc, and as each
item is selected, the appropriate number of kilobytes required will be
shown. You have the
option to [Quit] at this stage, in which case you will be returned to
the Workbench or CLI,
depending on how the Installer was booted. Otherwise, when the required
items have been
selected, click on [Install].</p>

<p><b>Step Seven</b><br>

If [Install] is chosen, a file selector appears, and you are
requested to select the device and
current path for the installation of AMOS Professional. After making
your selection, click on
[OK] to proceed to Step Eight of the Installation procedure.
Alternatively, the [Cancel] option
will return you to Step Six again.</p>

<p><b>Step Eight</b><br>

Everything is now automatic. If there is not enough memory
available on the selected device,
this fact will be reported. You will be returned to Step Six to make a
more modest selection.
Otherwise, a loading and saving sequence is displayed, consisting of an
Installation report for
each named file, in the form of a percentage figure and an animated bar.</p>

<p><b>Step Nine</b><br>

Once all files have been successfully installed on hard disc, a final
report is displayed, along with an option to [Quit].</p>

<p>The installation procedure will analyse what type of system it
is being installed onto
and will configure your AMOS Professional software appropriately.<br>
See <a href="../13/1301.html">Chapter 13.1</a> regarding these settings.</p>
