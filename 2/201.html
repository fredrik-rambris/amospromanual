<h1>Installing Amos Professional</h1>

<br>

<p>The AMOS Professional package contains this User Guide, an
accompanying Applications Supplement, your Registration Card and the
following floppy discs:</p>

<p><b>System disc</b> (AMOSPro_System:)<br>

The System Disc contains the bones, muscles, heart and soul of AMOS
Professional! All of the system libraries are held here, as well as
items such as communications devices, fonts and the installation
program.</p>

<p><b>Examples disc</b> (AMOSPro_Examples:)<br>

This disc is packed with hundreds of instant examples of AMOS
Professional in action. These files can be summoned up as you program,
via the superb AMOS Professional Help system.</p>

<p><b>Tutorial disc</b> (AMOSPro_Tutorial:)<br>

For detailed step-by-step examples on specialised subjects, the
Tutorial disc offers private tuition on a range of topics, including
animation, special effects, menus, Bobs and Sprites.</p>

<p><b>Accessories disc</b> (AMOSPro_Accessories:)<br>

This disc contains a full range of AMOS Professional Accessories.</p>

<p><b>Productivity discs 1 and
2 </b>(AMOSPro_Productivity1:,AMOSPro_Productivity2:)<br>

These discs feature complete AMOS Professional games and utilities. All
programs are fully annotated and ready for you to enjoy, explore and
adapt. Full details of these ready-made AMOS Professional programs are
contained in your Applications Supplement booklet.</p>

<p><b>AMOS Professional Installation Procedure</b><br>

To prepare AMOS Professional ready for your exploitation and
enjoyment, the System Disc must be installed for all users, and other
features made accessible for hard disc users. This is very simple and
all instructions are displayed on screen, step by step. Here is an
outline of the installation procedure from a floppy disc:</p>

<p><b>Step One</b><br>

Take the disc labelled AMOSPro_System:, and make sure that it
is write-enabled. In other words, ensure that the tab at the top
right-hand corner of the disc is in the closed position, so that it
covers the small square hole. This will allow you to personalise your
copy of AMOS Professional, with your own name appearing on screen to
greet you.</p>

<p>If your Amiga is switched on, make sure that the drive light
is <b>not</b> illuminated, and take out any disc that may
be in the drive.
Switch <b>off</b> your computer and wait about twenty
seconds to let it clear
its memory and forget any bad habits that may be lurking there.</p>

<p>Place the write-enabled AMOS Professional System Disc into the
internal floppy drive, and switch on.</p>

<p><b>Step Two</b><br>

Sit back and enjoy the AMOS Professional animated musical
introduction! After a short pause, this screen fades and the next
screen appears.</p>
