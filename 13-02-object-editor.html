    <h1>The Object Editor</h1>


    <p>
        The Object Editor is a utility that enables the AMOS Professional programmer to create and edit
        screen Objects such as Bobs, Hardware Sprites, Computed Sprites, Icons and Blocks. The Object
        Editor allows you to change the appearance of Objects in an almost limitless way and it even
        includes your own animation suite!</p>
</section>

<section id="01-loading-the-object-editor">
    <h2>Loading the Object Editor</h2>
    <p>
        The best way to understand the Object Editor is to go ahead and use it. It can be selected from
        the User Menu by triggering the [Object Editor] option.
        Alternatively, make sure that the Accessories disc is loaded and select the following program
        from the File Selector:<br>

    <pre>
Object_Editor.AMOS
</pre>

    <p>
        The Object Editor is crammed full of data. In fact it contains so many features that they cannot
        all be accommodated in the amount of memory reserved for the editing buffer, if the Object
        Editor is loaded using the File Selector. A message will appear in the Information Line asking if
        you want to change the buffer size, and you should respond by pressing [Y] before you can run
        the Object Editor.</p>

    <p>
        When the Object Editor has loaded, a Main Menu Screen appears. Before you go any further,
        load some Object images into the Object Editor to provide something practical to work on.
        Please follow these steps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Look at the line of boxed images at the top of the screen. In the top left-hand corner is a panel
            that says "Object Editor". Next to that is a panel displaying an icon of a disc drive. Click on
            this disc drive icon with the <b>left</b> mouse button, and leave the mouse cursor exactly where it is.
        </li>
        <li>A new range of images should now be displayed at the top of the screen. Using the left mouse
            button, please click on the box that shows a floppy disc with an arrow pointing to the right
            towards a "storage bank" building.
        </li>
        <li>A file selector should now appear, headed "Choose an Object bank". From the Tutorial disc,
            select the folder marked "*Objects", then load the "Bobs.Abk" file.
        </li>
        <li>The Main Menu Screen will now fill with various Object images. When this happens, move
            your mouse pointer to anywhere in the top line of images, and click on the right mouse
            button. You are now ready to experience the wonders of the AMOS Professional Object
            Editor.
        </li>
    </ul>

</section>

<section id="02-the-main-menu-screen">
    <h2>The Main Menu Screen</h2>
    <p>
        Here is an illustration of the Main Menu Screen, with a typical Object image ready to be worked
        on. Please identify each of the areas of this screen, as they are described.</p>

    <img alt="Object Editor Screen"
         src="images/1309object.jpg"/>

    <p><b>MAJOR OPTIONS</b><br>
        At the very top of the Main Menu Screen there is a horizontal line of large icons. These represent
        all the major options for importing, handling and exporting Object images. At the far left is the
        Object Editor identification logo, and then from left to right the icons are used to call up menus
        for the following options: disc operations, image bank operations, grabbing images, hot spots,
        palette colours, screen resolutions and animations. At the right-hand side of these icons, is the
        [Quit] icon.</p>

    <p><b>INFORMATION LINE</b><br>
        Immediately below the line of Major Options is the Information Line. This line provides a
        running commentary on what is happening. It tells you how much memory is available,
        reminds you of what operation is taking place and provides prompts to help create graphic
        wonders.</p>

    <p><b>DRAWING TOOLS</b><br>
        The third horizontal section from the top of the screen shows a line of smaller icons.</p>

    <p>
        Each of these is used to provide one of the special drawing tools for creating and changing the
        appearance of Object images, and they are explained in detail, later in this Chapter.</p>

    <p><b>MOUSE COLOURS</b><br>
        At the left-hand edge of the screen is a stack of small coloured blocks.</p>


    <p>
        At the top of this stack are three double-height coloured blocks. The first two colour blocks show
        the colours currently under the control of the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> mouse buttons, when used for
        drawing. The third double-height colour block shows the colour currently used when <b>both</b>
        mouse buttons are pressed at once, when drawing.</p>

    <p><b>COLOUR PALETTE</b><br>
        The vertical display of all the colours in the current palette can be seen below the mouse colours.
        The total umber of the palette colours depends on what sort of "resolution" is being used, and if
        64 colours are available, then colours numbered from 32 to 63 will appear in order, side by side
        of colours zero to 31. To select a colour, place the mouse pointer over your choice, and click
        either the left or right mouse button to allocate that colour to that button. A third colour can be
        selected by pressing both buttons, and it is used when both buttons are depressed. Obviously, if
        you have a three-button mouse, choosing and using the third colour is easier. Select a pair of
        contrasting colours now, such as white and bright red.</p>

    <p><b>CURRENT DISPLAY</b><br>
        Now look at the vertical stack of zones at the right-hand side of the screen. At the top of this
        stack, immediately below the [UNDO] icon, there is a square box which displays the "fill
        pattern" currently available for use. Place the mouse pointer inside it now, and run through all
        the available fill patterns, using the left button to move forwards and the right button to go
        backwards through the list. This box is also used to display a read-out of the coordinates of the
        mouse pointer when images are edited.</p>

    <p><b>BANK DISPLAY</b><br>
        Beneath the Current Display box, the images in the current bank are displayed one on top of the
        other, and the number of each image appears <b>above</b> it. Each image is shrunk in size so that all of
        it may be viewed in its own rectangular display box. To select an image for attention, click the
        mouse pointer on it, and you will see that its number becomes <b>highlighted</b>. Any image that is
        currently being edited is marked with an asterisk star (*) in front of its number.</p>

    <p><b>BANK SLIDER</b><br>
        To the right of the stack where the bank of images will appear, there is a vertical slider bar.
        Because there can be hundreds of images in any one bank, and there can only be enough space
        to view a few of them at a time, this slider is pulled up and down with the mouse pointer to
        display other images in the bank. Use it now to view all the images currently loaded.</p>

    <p><b>SCREEN SIZER</b><br>
        To the right-of-centre of the screen is a narrow vertical bar, which can be dragged to the left or
        right using the mouse pointer, if you need to change the proportions of the Edit Screen. The
        right-hand zone is the EDIT WINDOW, where images that are being edited are viewed in actual
        size. The left-hand zone is the ZOOM WINDOW area, where you can view your work in close-
        up, as it progresses.</p>

    <p><b>ZOOM WINDOW</b><br>
        The Zoom Window displays a blow-up version of the image, allowing greater accuracy and ease
        of use while editing. The zoom is normally set to double the size of the original graphics,
        and there is an option to make this four times the size, which is explained later.</p>


    <p><b>EDIT WINDOW</b><br>
        Like the Zoom Window, this is a work area. The mouse pointer changes to a cross when inside
        either the Zoom or the Edit Window, and drawing operations will have the same result in both
        windows no matter which one is being used.</p>

    <p><b>VERTICAL ZOOM</b><br>
        On the right-hand edge of the Edit Window is a vertical slider bar. This indicates other available
        areas of the image when the Zoom Window is unable to show the whole of what is inside the
        Edit Window. By moving this slider up and down, the hidden areas may be displayed in the
        Zoom Window.</p>

    <p><b>HORIZONTAL ZOOM</b><br>
        This has the same function and operation as the Vertical Zoom, and moves the display
        horizontally. The Horizontal Zoom slider is to be found at the bottom of the Edit Window.</p>

    <p><b>OBJECT SIZER</b><br>
        The last feature of the Edit Screen takes up the smallest space on the screen, and it can be found
        in the bottom right-hand corner of the Edit Window, where the vertical and horizontal sliders
        meet. If you look at the Information Line, the size of the current image will be displayed there.
        To change the size of an image, lock the mouse pointer on the small square Sizer gadget, and
        drag it to a new position. The maximum sizes of Sprites, Bobs, Blocks and Icons are all detailed
        in their appropriate Chapters, but boundaries should generally be kept as tight as possible, to
        save memory.</p>

    <p><b>Major Options</b><br>

        Here is a guided tour of all the Major Options featured in the Object Editor, as they appear from
        left to right along the top line of the Main Menu. Please try out each option as it is explained, by
        clicking the left mouse button on the appropriate icon. This will take you to the option's Sub
        Menu.</p>

    <p>
        You can return to the Main Menu at any time, by clicking the <b>left</b> mouse button on the menu
        title icon, at the top left-hand corner of the screen, or by clicking the <b>right</b> mouse button
        anywhere along the top line of icons. For most other operations please use the <b>left</b> button,
        unless instructed otherwise.</p>
</section>

<section id="03-disc-operations">
    <h2>Disc Operations</h2>
    <p>

        <img alt="Disc Icon"
             src="images/1311disc.jpg" align="left"/>

        As soon as you click on this Disc Operation icon, it reappears at the top left-hand
        corner of the screen, and five new icons are revealed along the top of the screen.
        From left to right, they perform the following wonders:</p>

    <p><b>Load New Bank from Disc</b><br>

        <img alt="Load New bank Icon"
             src="images/1311loadbank.jpg" align="left"/>

        This prepares the Object Editor for loading a new range of images into the
        Object bank. A series of messages is provided in the Information Line, to
        assist you in making the right decisions. If the "Bobs.Abk" file is ready to be
        accessed, click on this icon and then trigger the [YES] option.</p>


    <p>A file listing will appear Automatically, with the request:</p>

    <p>Choose an Object bank</p>

    <p>
        You will normally make your choice by clicking on the Objects folder, selecting the file of
        Objects that takes your fancy, and then confirming your choice by clicking on the [OK] option.
        The Object images will load automatically, and you will be returned to the main Edit Screen. If
        you have already loaded "Bobs.Abk", simply click on [Quit] to return to the Object Editor. Please
        try to resist the temptation of exploring icons at random, and take a little time to follow this
        guided tour step by step. You will learn much faster in this way, and it will be more
        entertaining.</p>

    <p><b>Merge New Bank</b><br>

        <img alt="Merge New Bank Icon"
             src="images/1312mergebank.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is used to insert a completely new bank of Object images at the position of
        the selected Object in the current bank. Experiment with this option, and merge a
        new bank of images with your existing Object images.</p>

    <p>
        Use exactly the same method that was employed to load your original choice, but select a
        different file of Object images. When you return to the Edit Screen, click on the slider bar to the
        right of the vertical block of Objects on screen, and run it up and down to display the current
        Object images in memory. You can see where the new bank has been merged with the original
        bank, and the colour palette will have changed to the palette used by the newly merged bank of
        Object images.</p>

    <p><b>Save Bank</b><br>

        <img alt="Save Bank Icon"
             src="images/1312savebank.jpg" align="left"/>

        To save edited Objects, have a suitable disc ready in the disc drive, and click on this icon.
        A file selector will be displayed if your Object bank has no name, and all instructions are
        prompted on screen.</p>

    <p>
        Please do not use any of your AMOS Professional discs for this purpose, but format a work disc,
        using the [FORMAT] option in the Disc Manager.</p>

    <p><b>Save As</b><br>

        <img alt="Save As Icon"
             src="images/1312saveas.jpg" align="left"/>

        Similarly, only use a formatted work disc for this purpose. Unlike the [Save Bank]
        option, when this [Save As] icon is chosen, a file selector will always be displayed
        before the current Object bank is saved.</p>

    <p>
        After naming the bank, instructions are given on screen. As with all of these options, AMOS
        Professional allows you to change your mind or [Quit] at any time during the current process.</p>

    <p><b>Grab Palette</b><br>

        <img alt="Grab Palette Icon"
             src="images/1312grabpal.jpg" align="left"/>

        When this icon is selected, nothing is seen immediately, but the colour palette is
        automatically updated to the colours of the new Object bank, whenever that bank is
        loaded or merged.</p>

    <p>
        If you do not select this option, the original palette will remain for the loading or
        merging process. To de-select this option, simply click on the icon once more.</p>


    <p>
        After experimenting with those options, the colours on your screen may be looking messy, and
        if this is so you should re-load the Objects in the following file:</p>

    <pre>
"AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Bobs.Abk"
</pre>

    <p>
        We now move on to the second Major Option, so return to the Main Menu Screen by using the
        right mouse button to click the mouse pointer in the top line of icons, and select the Bank
        Operations icon.</p>
</section>

<section id="04-bank-operations">
    <h2>Bank Operations</h2>
    <p>
        <img alt="Bank Icon"
             src="images/1313bank.jpg" align="left"/>

        When this Major Option is selected, you take control of all aspects of the Object
        bank. The Bank icon moves to the top left corner of the screen, and the Major
        Options top line is replaced by a series of eight new Bank icons, as follows:</p>

    <p><b>Get Object</b><br>

        <img alt="Get Object Icon"
             src="images/1313getobject.jpg" align="left"/>

        First, <b>highlight</b> the Object you are interested in, by clicking the mouse pointer
        over the appropriate image on the right-hand side of the screen. Now click on this
        [Get Object] option, and the highlighted Object appears in the large Zoom
        Window and the smaller Edit Window, ready to be worked on.</p>

    <p>
        It is highly probable that you are impatient to change the appearance of whatever image you
        have selected, and there is no harm in experimenting. Please be patient and work through this
        Chapter step by step, because there is much more enjoyment to be had in knowing what you
        are doing. For the time being, try clicking on the small icon that shows a pair of arrows pointing
        up and down, in the line of drawing tools. This will turn the current Object upside down. Leave
        it like that, and continue with the next option.</p>

    <p><b>Put Object</b><br>

        <img alt="Put Object Icon"
             src="images/1313putobject.jpg" align="left"/>

        Once the appearance of the edited Object has been changed by flipping it on its
        head, this option is used to put the Object back into its memory bank. It will go
        back to its <b>original</b> location in the bank, if that location has been defined.</p>

    <p>You can see this original location by looking for the Object with the highlighted identification
        number, marked with an asterisk (*).</p>

    <p><b>Put Object To</b><br>

        <img alt="Put Object To Icon"
             src="images/1313pobjectto.jpg" align="left"/>

        You can select a new Object to highlight simply by clicking on its image. Use this option
        if you want to force the edited Object into the location that is currently highlighted in
        the bank, and replace whatever is there. You will be asked to confirm your actions, just
        to make sure.</p>

    <p><b>Insert Object</b><br>

        <img alt="Insert Object Icon"
             src="images/1313insobject.jpg" align="left"/>

    <p>
        This is a fast method of inserting an Object from the editing windows straight into the
        highlighted position in the bank, without replacing the Object that is already sitting in
        that position. The other Objects in the bank will then shunt along to make room for it.</p>


    <p>Try using this option now.</p>

    <p><b>Delete Object</b><br>

        <img alt="Delete Object Icon"
             src="images/1314delobject.jpg" align="left"/>

        This will erase the highlighted Object completely, so take care when using it. As a safety
        measure, AMOS Professional will not be happy about deleting any Object that is <b>not</b>
        currently displayed on screen, and even then it will ask you to confirm your wishes. Use
        it now, and delete an Object.</p>

    <p><b>New</b><br>

        <img alt="New Icon"
             src="images/1314new.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is an even more dramatic option than [Delete Object], because it erases <b>all</b> the
        Object images in the entire memory bank. As usual, you will be asked to make sure of
        your actions before you commit them. If you use the [New] option now, you will have to
        load another bank before you can continue experimenting with Object images.</p>

    <p><b>Auto</b><br>

        <img alt="Auto Icon"
             src="images/1314auto.jpg" align="left"/>

        This option is enabled and disabled by clicking the mouse pointer over it, toggling it in
        and out like a radio button. It affects the [AUTO-GET] feature, which automatically
        places data into the memory bank by clicking twice on a stored Object image.
        You may want to use this option to avoid accidentally grabbing hold of some garbage,
        preventing it being automatically placed amongst your Objects.</p>

    <p><b>Confirm</b><br>

        <img alt="Confirm Icon"
             src="images/1314confirm.jpg" align="left"/>

        While editing Object images, there are times when AMOS Professional tries to be helpful
        by asking you to confirm your actions. For example, when you try to [ERASE] an Object
        or use the [PUT TO] option. If these reminders cause any annoyance, you can click on
        this icon to disable the Confirmation feature. To reactivate it, simply click on the icon again.</p>
</section>

<section id="05-the-grabber">
    <h2>The Grabber</h2>
    <p>
        <img alt="Grabber Icon"
             src="images/1314thegrabber.jpg" align="left"/>

        Once you are familiar with all of the Bank Operations, you can move on to the next
        Major Option. The Grabber is used to grab images from IFF pictures, which are graphic
        screen images saved in the special "Interchangeable File Format", as used by commercial
        graphics packages like Deluxe Paint.</p>

    <p><b>Grab Object</b><br>

        <img alt="Grab Object Icon"
             src="images/1314grabobject.jpg" align="left"/>

        When this option is selected, you will be reminded to load an IFF file only, and a
        suitable ready-made picture is provided for loading in the following file:</p>

    <pre>
"AmosPro_Examples:Iff/Logo.Iff"
</pre>

    <p>
        The file requester will only appear if there is no picture currently selected. When you have
        confirmed your choice with an [OK], the selected IFF picture is displayed on screen. As you move
        the mouse, coordinate lines will follow your movements. Position the mouse pointer at the top
        left-hand corner of the part of the picture you want to use as an Object image, then using the <b>left</b>
        button, keep it held down until you have chosen the bottom right-hand corner of the image. If
        you make a mistake, click on the <b>right</b> button.</p>


    <p>
        When you are happy with the rectangle of graphics to be grabbed, click on the left button again.
        The Edit Screen now holds your new image. There is an auto-resolution mode that is explained
        later, which will ensure that the best graphics mode is used.</p>

    <p><b>Put Object</b><br>

        <img alt="Put Object Icon"
             src="images/1315putobject.jpg" align="left"/>

        This works in the same way as the [Put Object To] option in the Bank menu. It
        allows you to grab an image and put it into memory instantly, without having to
        wander from one menu to another.</p>

    <p><b>Load Picture</b><br>

        <img alt="Load Picture Icon"
             src="images/1315loadpic.jpg" align="left"/>

        This time, when the file selector appears, you will be reminded to save any current
        image in the editing area that has not been saved to the Object bank. Then the
        name of a new picture to load may be selected.</p>

    <p><b>Grab Palette</b><br>

        <img alt="Grab Palette Icon"
             src="images/1315grabpal.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is an on/off option that is toggled by a mouse click. If it is on, the current palette will
        automatically change to the palette used by the current picture. If it is off, no change to
        the palette will be made.</p>

    <p><b>Re-load Picture</b><br>

        <img alt="ReLoad Picture Icon"
             src="images/1315reload.jpg" align="left"/>

        This icon is linked to the next two icons, and the three of them act like radio station
        selectors. In other words, only one can be pushed in at a time, and when any one is
        activated, the other two will click off. With [Re-load Picture], the graphic image is
        completely erased when you return to the Main Menu, allowing you to create more Objects.</p>

    <p>
        This is useful if you do not have much memory available, and a large IFF screen may be using a
        vast amount of it.</p>

    <p><b>Pack Picture</b><br>

        <img alt="Pack Picture Icon"
             src="images/1315pack.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is also a memory saver. It takes the current screen picture, and packs it into a
        memory bank using "fast RAM", which does not consume display memory. When you
        leave the Grabber menu for the first time, this will take a little while to perform, as
        AMOS professional searches for the most efficient way to save memory.</p>

    <p><b>Keep Screen</b><br>

        <img alt="Keep Screen Icon"
             src="images/1315keep.jpg" align="left"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        This option keeps the entire screen exactly as it is, providing you have enough memory
        available in "chip RAM".</p>

<section id="06-the-hot-spot">
    <h2>The Hot Spot</h2>
    <p>
        <img alt="Hot Spot Icon"
             src="images/1315hot.jpg" align="left"/>

        The next menu concerns setting up any hot spots for Objects. In most computer games
        and in several types of practical programs, hot spots can be set up inside moving images
        as coordinate reference points. When these coordinates are recognised, they are used to
        trigger pre-set reactions. Because Objects can vary greatly in size, it is very useful to be able to
        place a hot spot precisely. Once inside the Hot Spot menu, you can go straight into the Zoom or
        Edit Window and use the mouse to place and set the coordinates.</p>


    <p>Otherwise use one of the automatic settings, as explained next.</p>

    <p><b>Auto Off</b><br>

        <img alt="Auto Off Icon"
             src="images/1316autooff.jpg" align="left"/>

        If you click on this icon, so it looks as if it has been pushed in, any of the hot spot pre-
        sets can be used to position a hot spot for the current image. If it is not used, you will be
        in an automatic mode, which means that every image summoned by [GET OBJECT] into
        the Edit Window will have a hot spot automatically set to the <b>last pre-set</b> position.</p>

    <p>
        This is very useful if you want a whole range of Objects to have their hot spots in the same
        place.</p>

    <p><b>Hot Spot Pre-sets</b><br>

        <img alt="Hot Spot Pre-set Icon"
             src="images/1316preset.jpg" align="left"/>

        There are nine icon boxes, each showing the position of a pre-set hot spot. If the Auto
        option is <b>off</b>, you may select the hot spot of the current Object by clicking on any one of
        these pre-sets. They are, in order of appearance, Top Left, Top Centre, Top Right, Centre
        Left, Dead Centre, Centre Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Centre and Bottom Right.</p>

    <p>
        Select a pre-set now, and check its setting by moving your cursor into the Zoom or Edit
        Window. When you want to get back to the Main Menu, click the right mouse button in the top
        line of icons, as usual.</p>
</section>

<section id="07-palette-colours">
    <h2>Palette Colours</h2>
    <p>
        <img alt="Colour Palette Icon"
             src="images/1316palette.jpg" align="left"/>

        This Major Option is used to mix new colours for your Object images to use. As soon as
        this icon is selected, a large colour requester display appears over the Edit Screen,
        alongside the vertical display of all the colours in the current palette. The colour
        requester looks like this:</p>

    <div align="center">

        <img alt="Colour Palette Requester"
             src="images/1316requester.jpg"/>

    </div>


    <p>
        The colour requester acts like a colour mixing box. If the box obscures the images on display in
        the Edit or Zoom Windows, it can be moved around the screen by clicking on the top bar and
        dragging, to reveal the images beneath. Look at the colour requester box now.</p>

    <p>
        On the left there is a stack of sixteen values for colour saturation, given in hexadecimals from
        zero up to F. To the right of this are three vertical sliding bars, one each for the Red, Green and
        Blue components of each colour. On the right of the panel is a stack of four boxes, as follows:</p>

    <p>[OK] is triggered when you are happy with any colour changes, and want to keep them.</p>

    <p>
        [UNDO] will ignore any of your current colour changes, and return the palette to whatever
        values were held before your latest changes.</p>

    <p>[QUIT] leaves the colour requester, and ignores any changes you may have made.</p>

    <p>
        Below this, there is a Colour Code Box, showing the value of the RGB components of the current
        colour, in hexadecimals.</p>

    <p>
        The Colour Panel at the bottom right of the panel displays the colour that is currently receiving
        your attention.</p>

    <p><b>Mixing new colours</b><br>

        To change colours in the current palette, first select one colour by moving the mouse pointer
        over any of the colours in the vertical palette display at the left-hand side of the screen. Now
        click inside any of the RGB slider bars and move them up and down until you are satisfied with
        the new colour mix. You can then change one of the other colours in the palette, or use [OK],
        [UNDO] or [QUIT], as described above.</p>

    <p>
        If you alter the colour that is currently used for the 'framework' outlines used within the Edit
        Screen, be careful not to merge this with the background colour, and cause confusion on screen.
        If this does happen, and the Edit Screen becomes difficult to view, AMOS Professional will get
        you out of trouble. Although you use the left mouse button to click on colours of your choice,
        you may go directly to the vertical palette display and use the <b>right</b> mouse button, and change
        the colours of the Edit Screen directly.</p>

    <p>
        The vertical palette display may show 64 colours instead of 32 in certain modes, but only colours
        ranging from zero to 31 may be changed. This is because colours 32 to 63, which are used in
        Extra Half Bright Mode, automatically take the first 32 colours to create versions which are
        exactly half as bright as the originals. These new colours will only change when their "original"
        neighbours are changed.</p>

<section id="08-screen-resolution">
    <h2>Screen Resolution</h2>
    <p>
        <img alt="Resolution Icon"
             src="images/1317res.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is the menu which controls the screen colour resolutions. It defines the number of
        colours used by Object images, which may have to be adjusted to suit various screen
        formats. To see how powerful it is, have some high-definition IFF images displayed in
        the Edit Window, before you start experimenting.</p>


    <p><b>Adjust</b><br>

        <IMG alt="Adjust Icon"
             src="images/1318adjust.jpg" align=left>

        This is a very powerful option. If it is <b>on</b>, any Object taken from the bank will
        change the current palette to its own resolution preference. If the option is off, the
        number of colours remains unchanged.</p>

    <p>
        This can have one of two effects. Either the Object has <b>less</b> colours than your current screen,
        and nothing is lost. Alternatively, if the Object has <b>more</b> colours than the current screen,
        then the higher value colours are lost. The bank will remain unchanged until the Object is
        deposited into it again. This [ADJUST] option is normally <b>on</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Hi-Res</b><br>

        <IMG alt="High Resolution Icon"
             src="images/1318hires.jpg" align=left>

        This is also an on/off switch, which selects the current screen mode, with the
        maximum number of colours in high resolution being 16. Everything else in the
        program remains unchanged, except for these colour resolutions.</p>

    <p><b>Number of Colours</b><br>

        <IMG alt="No. Colours Icon"
             src="images/1318numcolours.jpg" align=left>

        A choice of six options is available, instantly selecting the number of colours displayed
        on the Edit Screen, as follows: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64.</p>
</section>

<section id="09-animation">
    <h2>Animation</h2>
    <p>
        <IMG alt="Animation Icon"
             src="images/1318anim.jpg" align=left>

        AMOS Professional allows you to test an animated movie sequence of the Object images
        which are currently loaded. This is extremely useful, as well as very entertaining.</p>

    <p>You can test the system now, using the Objects in this file:</p>

    <pre>
"AMOSPro_Tutorial:Objects/Play_Bobs.Abk"
</pre>

    <p>
        When the [Animation] icon is selected, the Edit Screen gives way to your own animation suite!.A
        diagram of this facility is shown below.</p>

    <div align="center">

        <IMG height=407 alt
                ="Animation Screen" src="images/1318animscreen.jpg" width=486>

    </div>


    <p>
        If you are using the PAL or SECAM television display systems, there are 16 individual movie
        "<b>frames</b>" displayed in the top half of the screen, that can take one image each. If you are using
        the NTSC system, there will be eight frames available. These alternative systems are fully
        discussed in <a href="14-appendix-c-pal-and-ntsc.html">Appendix C</a> of this User Guide.</p>

    <p>
        Below these frames is your "<b>movie screen</b>", where the individual frames will be shown,
        animated one after the other.</p>

    <p>
        Next to that is a horizontal slider bar for adjusting the <b>speed</b> of animation, from zero for "still
        video" up to 100 for a "turbo" speed of 50 frames per second in PAL mode, or 60 frames per
        second in NTSC.</p>

    <p>The Quit box is down near the bottom right-hand corner.</p>

    <p>
        To the right of the screen is a vertical stack where the current Object bank can be examined as
        usual, by running up and down its slider bar.</p>

    <p><b>Using the Animation feature</b><br>

        To put any Object image into an animation sequence, all you have to do is click on it to make it
        appear in a movie frame. As soon as more than one image has been transferred in this way, the
        animation sequence begins to move, in the same order that the images were transferred.</p>

    <p>
        To remove any individual image from the animation sequence, click on its movie frame image in
        the horizontal strip of frames, and it will disappear. This will cause all the following frames to
        shunt backwards towards the beginning of the sequence, and fill the gap.</p>

    <p>
        The position of the Object animations on the "movie screen" is changed using the mouse
        pointer, and hot spots are automatically positioned beneath the mouse cursor when the mouse
        button in clicked.</p>

    <p>
        After you [Quit] the animation suite, the movie sequence is held in memory, and the next time
        the [Animation] icon is triggered, the last recorded sequence will greet you.</p>

    <p>
        To delete a sequence from memory, one of three things must happen:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>One of the animation images is deleted from the memory bank.</li>
        <li>A new Object image bank is selected.</li>
        <li>The original bank is erased.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Quit</b><br>

        <img alt="Quit Icon"
             src="images/1319quit.jpg" align="left"/>

        As you might expect, the white flag icon gives up the Object editing process and
        surrenders to your next bout of programming. In case you forget to save anything to be
        used in the future, AMOS Professional will offer a timely reminder.</p>
</section>

<section id="10-the-object-editor-drawing-tools">
    <h2>The Object Editor Drawing Tools</h2>
    <p>
        Beneath the line of Major Options icons, there is a whole line of smaller icons to explore.</p>


    <p>
        This menu line is completely independent from the Major Options, and contains all of the
        d rowing tools which can be used at any suitable time. These drawing operations only effect the
        visible part of the Object image that is being edited. You are invited to tackle them now, from
        left to right.</p>

    <p><b>DOT PLOT</b><br>

        <img alt="Single dot button"
             src="images/1320dot.jpg" align="left"/>

        Click on this icon now, and experiment by clicking the mouse button in the editing
        window, to plot single pixels. Then keep the button held down, and move the mouse
        around at different speeds to see the different effects that can be achieved.</p>

    <p>
        Now try the other mouse buttons, then both buttons together to remind yourself that the top
        three colours in the vertical palette refer to the left, right and combined mouse buttons. If you
        have a three-button mouse, the third button will make use of the third colour automatically.</p>

    <p><b>LINE PLOT</b><br>

        <img alt="Continuous dot button"
             src="images/1320line.jpg" align="left"/>

        This offers a continuous solid line plot. The speed of mouse movement
        makes no difference at all to its usage.</p>

    <p><b>DRAW</b><br>

        <img alt="Draw Icon"
             src="images/1320draw.jpg" align="left"/>

        Before this drawing tool can be used effectively, you should design it for yourself! First of
        all, set the size and positioning of your own "line" by clicking anywhere in the Edit
        Window, holding down the mouse button, dragging it and then letting go.
        Now use your own shape to paint and draw with. Further along the line of drawing icons, you
        will see how the [MODE] button changes certain drawing operations. If it is selected and used
        with [DRAW], then lines are drawn as soon as the mouse button is released.</p>

    <p><b>BOX</b><br>

        <img alt="Box button"
             src="images/1320box.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is an extremely simple option. Click the mouse button to set any corner of a box, keep
        the button held down while the diagonally opposite corner is located, then let go. One box
        appears, ready to be used as a brush, or pasted again as many times as you like, by moving the
        mouse and clicking a button.</p>

    <p>
        Remember that a third colour is available for drawing operations, by pressing both mouse
        buttons together.</p>

    <p><b>ELLIPSE</b><br>

        <img alt="Ellipse button"
             src="images/1320ellipse.jpg" align="left"/>

        This works in exactly the same way as [BOX], except that ellipses do not have corners. Set
        the boundary points of your ellipse as described above, or create circles by making the two
        radii of the ellipse equal.</p>

    <p><b>AIR-BRUSH</b><br>

        <img alt="Air brush button"
             src="images/1320airbrush.jpg" align="left"/>

        To set different spray effects, click the <b>right</b> mouse button on this icon. This will reveal a
        selector menu for customising the air-brush spray can. Both the "power" of the jet and the
        width of the spray nozzle can be adjusted from 1 up to 100, and the [OK] button is used to exit
        from the selector to commence spraying.</p>

    <p>
        Experiment to see the various effects, or if you prefer to spray without customising
        your own air-brush, click on the icon with the <b>left</b> mouse button.</p>


    <p><b>BAR</b><br>

        <img alt="Bar button"
             src="images/1321bar.jpg" align="left"/>

        Set up diagonally opposite corners of a bar in the usual way, and then release the button to
        fill it with the current colour, or selected pattern. The outline of the bar can be toggled off
        and on by clicking on the border section of the current Pattern Display window.</p>

    <p><b>PAINT ROLLER or FILL</b><br>

        <img alt="Fill button"
             src="images/1321fill.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is a dramatic drawing tool! Position your paint roller cursor anywhere inside an
        enclosed shape, and it will be filled with instant colour or pattern. New patterns can be
        selected from the Pattern Display window.</p>

    <p><b>TEXT CAPTIONS</b><br>

        Select this icon, then click the mouse button in a likely position inside the Edit Window,
        and start typing one line of characters. Of course, not much text can be squeezed inside an
        Object, unless it happens to be extremely wide!</p>

    <p>
        Now reposition the text by dragging and clicking the mouse, and pasting multiple copies of the
        text if you wish. Outline and shadow effects may be created, using different colours.</p>

    <p><b>COPY BLOCK</b><br>

        <img alt="Copy block button"
             src="images/1321copy.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is used to copy a block of graphics from one Object to another. Click on, hold, move
        and click off to open the box in your picture, ready for pasting.</p>

    <p><b>PASTE BLOCK</b><br>

        <img alt="Paste block button"
             src="images/1321paste.jpg" align="left"/>

        Use this option to grab the previous block that has already been copied, and restore it to
        any position within the editing area. Try cutting and pasting a few blocks now.</p>

    <p><b>OPAQUE</b><br>

        <img alt="Opaque button"
             src="images/1321opaque.jpg" align="left"/>

        All the time this option is <b>off</b>, colour zero of the block which is being edited will be
        transparent. If you click the [OPAQUE] button <b>on</b>, colour zero is filled by the colour under
        the control of the <b>right</b> mouse button.</p>

    <p><b>CLEAR</b><br>

        <img alt="Clear button"
             src="images/1321clear.jpg" align="left"/>

        Everyone makes mistakes, and this option is the one that clears all of your current efforts
        away, leaving a blank Edit Window. Everyone makes several mistakes, and the [UNDO]
        icon is provided to bring it all back again!</p>

    <p>The next block of five drawing icons affects the entire image with dramatic results.</p>

    <p><b>SCROLL 1</b><br>

        <img alt="Scroll 1 button"
             src="images/1321scroll1.jpg" align="left"/>

        After selecting this option, grab the image in the Edit Window with your mouse and scroll
        it anywhere you want. Release the mouse button to leave the image at its new position.</p>

    <p><b>SCROLL 2</b><br>

        <img alt="Scroll 2 button"
             src="images/1321scroll2.jpg" align="left"/>

        This not only scrolls the image, but also wraps it back around itself when you hit the
        borders of the Edit Window.</p>


    <p><b>VERTICAL FLIP</b><br>

        <img alt="Vertical flip button"
             src="images/1322vflip.jpg" align="left"/>

        One click will cause an instant flip over the vertical axis of the Object image, and another
        click will flip it again. This technique works equally well on graphic blocks.</p>

    <p><b>HORIZONTAL FLIP</b><br>

        <img alt="Horizontal flip button"
             src="images/1322hflip.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is very similar to the last option, and reverses the image around its own horizontal
        axis.</p>

    <p><b>ROTATE</b><br>

        <img alt="Rotate button"
             src="images/1322rotate.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is used to rotate the entire Object image through ninety degrees clockwise. It takes a
        few seconds to compute the new image, and can be used again to keep the rotation going,
        all the way back to the original image.</p>

    <p>The next pair of options is provided to help you get a better view of your work.</p>

    <p><b>GRAB</b><br>

        <img alt="Grab button"
             src="images/1322grab.jpg" align="left"/>

        If an image is too large to fit inside the Edit Window, select this icon and then use the
        mouse to drag the image into view.</p>

    <p><b>ZOOM</b><br>

        <img alt="Zoom button"
             src="images/1322zoom.jpg" align="left"/>

        Click on this icon to double the size of the graphics in the Zoom Window to four times the
        size of the original image. Click it again to return to an image twice the size of the original.
        Remember that the relative sizes of the Zoom and Edit Screens can be adjusted by dragging the
        central Screen Sizer bar to suit your needs.</p>

    <p>The final group of three options each perform general tasks.</p>

    <p><b>BACKGROUND FRAMEWORK</b><br>

        <img alt="Framework button"
             src="images/1322frame.jpg" align="left"/>

        Every click on this icon selects the next colour in the palette for use with the framework
        graphics of the Edit Screen.</p>

    <p><b>MODE</b><br>

        <img alt="Mode button"
             src="images/1322mode.jpg" align="left"/>

        This up/down toggle sets the mode for certain drawing operations. <b>Up</b> gives Mode I,
        where an Object is drawn as soon as you release a mouse button. <b>Down</b> selects Mode 2,
        where you set the shape of a brush before using it for drawing.</p>

    <p><b>UNDO</b><br>

        <img alt="Undo button"
             src="images/1322undo.jpg" align="left"/>

        This is the fail-safe icon, allowing you to scrap the last drawing procedure, or cancel a
        [CLEAR] operation.</p>

    <p>
        Pressing the [Spacebar] key will select the <b>last</b> drawing tool that was used. This is a short-cut,
        allowing you to re-use an item without the need to go through the menu process.</p>
</section>

<section id="11-memory-alerts">
    <h2>Memory Alerts</h2>
    <p>Because Objects can nibble away at available memory, and because graphic screens consume
        large amounts, a low-memory alert system is built into the Object Editor.
        These alert messages will appear to help you automatically.</p>
