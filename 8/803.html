<h1>Music</h1>

<br>

<p><b>VOLUME</b><br>
<i>instruction: control sound volume</i><br>
<b>Volume</b> level<br>
<b>Volume</b> voice,level</p>

<p>
The VOLUME command controls the level of sound flowing through one or more channels,
ranging from zero (complete silence) up to 63 (ear-splitting), like this:</p>

<pre>
E> For L=0 To 63
    Volume L: Bell 80 : Wait 5
   Next L
</pre>

<p>
Once the VOLUME level has been set, all future sound effects and music will be delivered at
that level, across all four channels. In order to create stereo effects and perfect sound mixes, each
of the voices needs to be adjusted independently from one another.</p>

<p><b>VOICE</b><br>
<i>instruction: activate voice</i><br>
<b>Voice</b> bit-mask</p>

<p>
Soundtracks are made up of one or more voices, acting independently or together. The VOICE
command is used to activate voices by setting a bit-mask, with each bit representing the state of
one of the four available channels through which the voices flow. To play the required voice
(from 0 to 3) simply set the relevant bit to 1, otherwise a value of zero will keep the voice silent.
Here are some example settings:</p>

<pre>
X> Voice %1111 : Rem Activate all voices
   Voice %0001 : Rem Activate voice 0 only
   Voice %1001 : Rem Activate voices 3 and 0
</pre>

<p>The volume of each voice can now be controlled by specifying voices and volumes, like this:</p>

<pre>
E> Volume %0001,63
   Boom : Wait 100: Rem Channel 1 loud
   Volume %1110,5
   Boom : Wait 50: Rem Channels 2,3,4 soft
   Bell 40 : Wait 50 : Volume 60: Bell 40
</pre>

<p>
Here are some common values for voice settings, that can be used to make programming a little
easier:</p>

<pre>
<b>Value Voices used  Effect</b>
15    0,1,2,3      use all four voices
9     0,3          combine output to left speaker
6     2,4          combine output to right speaker
1     0            use voice 0
2     1            use voice 1
4     2            use voice 2
8     3            use voice 3
</pre>
