<h1>Music</h1>

<br>

<p>
The voice parameter contains a bit-map in the standard format, and if a bit pattern is set to 1
then the appropriate voice is used to PLY the sound. Remember that wave number zero is
already reserved for the NOISE channel, and wave number 1 contains a smooth sine wave for
pure tone. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>
E> Wave 1 To %1111 : Rem Play pure tone through all voices
   Play 60,0
   Wave 0 To %0001 : Rem Use voice 0 for noise
   Play 20,10
</pre>

<p><b>NOISE TO</b><br>
<i>instruction: assign noise wave to sound channel</i><br>
<b>Noise To</b> voices</p>

<p>
This command has the same effect as assigning the white noise wave form number zero to the
selected voices, and it is used to form the foundations for a whole range of special effects, such
as explosions and percussion drumming. The bit-pattern used to set one or more voices has
already been explained above. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
E> Noise To 15 Rem All four voices
   Play 60,50
   Play 30,0
</pre>

<p><b>SAMPLE</b><br>
<i>instruction: assign a sample to the current wave</i><br>
<b>Sample</b> number <b>To</b> voices</p>

<p>
This is the most powerful of the wave commands. SAMPLE is used to assign the specified sound
sample number, which is already stored in the Sample Bank, directly to the current wave form.
The voices to be used are set in the usual way. When PLAY is used, this sample will be taken
from the Sample Bank and used as the "musical instrument" to be played. Try this example:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Examples:Samples/Mixture.Abk",6
   Sam Bank 6
   Sample 5 To 15
   For S=20 To 50
    Play S,50
   Next S
</pre>

<p>
The pitch values that can be applied to any particular sample will vary, but normally anything
between 10 and 50 is satisfactory.</p>

<p><b>DEL WAVE</b><br>
<i>instruction: delete a wave</i><br>
<b>Del Wave</b> number</p>

<p>
To delete a wave that has been set up with a SET WAVE instruction, simply use this command
followed by the number of the wave to be erased.</p>
