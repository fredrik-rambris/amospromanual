<h1>Playing Music Modules</h1>

<br>

<p>
As with Tracker modules, AMOS Professional sound samples can be played while Med modules
are active. When a sound effect is triggered, any Med music will be stopped on all four voices,
and will start again as soon as the sample has been played.</p>

<p><b>MED PLAY</b><br>
<i>instruction: play a Med module</i><br>
<b>Med Play</b><br>
<b>Med Play</b> bank number,song number</p>

<p>
This instruction plays the specified currently loaded Med module. If no bank number parameter
is given, the data in the last appropriate bank to be loaded will be played. Med modules can
include more than one song, and an individual melody can be specified by including the song
number to be played, as follows:</p>

<pre>
X> Med Play 2
   Med Play ,2
   Med Play 2,2
</pre>

<p><b>MED STOP</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop the current Med module</i><br>
<b>Med Stop</b></p>

<p>
This simple instruction halts the current Med song being played. The song can now be started
from the beginning with a new call to MED PLAY, or continued using a MED CONT command.</p>

<p><b>MED CONT</b><br>
<i>instruction: continue a Med module</i><br>
<b>Med Cont</b></p>

<p>
This command is used to re-commence a Med module that has been halted by a MED STOP
instruction. The song will continue from the exact point at which it was stopped.</p>

<p><b>MED MIDI ON</b><br>
<i>instruction: access MIDI instructions in a Med module</i><br>
<b>Med Midi On</b></p>

<p>
MIDI is the international standard by which musical instruments talk to one another and stands
for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. If the Med module contains MIDI instructions for
controlling keyboards, drum machines and so on, the MED MIDI ON command must be given
<b>before</b> the first MED LOAD command, in other words, before the "Medplayer.library" file is
opened.</p>
