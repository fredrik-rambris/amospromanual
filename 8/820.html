<h1>Playing Music Modules</h1>

<br>

<p>
To start your Tracker module playing, give this command followed by the appropriate bank
number. If the bank number is omitted, bank number 6 will be used as a default.
Most electronic composers use sets of patterns to make up a tune, and these can be repeated in
any suitable order. A Tracker sequence can be started from any one of these patterns, providing
that you know which pattern number refers to which particular part of the sequence. An
optional pattern number can be added after the bank number parameter. Here are some
example settings:</p>

<pre>
X> Track Play : Rem Use default Tracker bank
   Track Play ,5 : Rem Play pattern 5 from default Tracker bank
   Track Play 9,5: Rem Play pattern 5 from bank 9
</pre>

<p><b>TRACK LOOP ON</b><br>
<b>TRACK LOOP OFF</b><br>
<i>instructions: toggle a Tracker loop</i><br>
<b>Track Loop On</b><br>
<b>Track Loop Off</b></p>

<p>
Use these commands to make Tracker modules loop over and over again, or to stop a particular
loop after it has commenced. Try this example:</p>

<pre>
E> Track Load "AMOSPro_Examples:Music/Mod.Tracker"
   Track Play
   Track Loop On
</pre>

<p><b>TRACK STOP</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop all Tracker music</i><br>
<b>Track Stop</b></p>

<p>This command is used to halt all Tracker modules playing.</p>

<p><b>Playing Med modules</b><br>

If you wish to play Med modules, the "Medplayer.library" file must be in your "Libs:" folder.
Naturally, if you have no intention of exploiting the Med library, there is no need to load it and
allocate unnecessary memory. Both "MMDO" and "MMD1" modules can be used for your
programs.</p>

<p><b>MED LOAD</b><br>
<i>instruction: load a Med module</i><br>
<b>Med Load</b> "Module name",bank number</p>

<p>
The MED LOAD instruction loads the specified module in memory, and re-locates it to the
specified reserved bank in Chip memory. This bank is <b>not</b> a data bank, and will <b>not</b> be saved along
with your program, so Med modules must be loaded anew each time that the program is run.</p>

<p>
This command will open the "Medplayer.library" file, and you may be asked to insert
your System disc into the drive if this file is not available on the current disc.</p>
