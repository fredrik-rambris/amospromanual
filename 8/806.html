<p>
The following program shows how the sort of wave form in the above diagram could be created
The wave form is then assigned to a wave and played, which is explained a little later.</p>

<pre>
E> S$=" " : Rem Clear wave form string
   For W=-128 To 127
    X=W : If X<0 Then Add X,256
    S$=S$+Chr$(X)
   Next W
   Set Wave 2,S$
   Wave 2 To 15: For S=10 to 60: Play S,10: Next S
</pre>

<p>
The wave forms of musical instruments are much more complicated than the last example, but
they are not too difficult to reproduce. By combining several sine waves together, with each sine
wave having a different starting point, the type of pattern shown in the next diagram is
achieved.</p>

<p>
This sort of wave form generates smooth harmonics, which can then be used as the "templates"
for musical notes, and the sort of routine in the next example can produce typical sine waves:</p>

<pre>
E> SHAPE$=" " : Degree
   For S=0 To 255
    V=Int((Sin(S)/2+Sin(S*2+45)/4)*128)+127
    SHAPE$=SHAPE$+Chr$(V)
   Next S
   Set Wave 2,SHAPE$ : Wave 2 To 15
   For N=10 To 60: Play N,10 : Next N
</pre>

<p><b>WAVE</b><br>
<i>instruction: assign a wave to sound channel</i><br>
<b>Wave</b> number <b>To</b> voices</p>

<p>
The WAVE command is used to assign the specified wave number to one or more sound
channels.</p>
