<h1>Samples</h1>

<br>

<p><b>SAM LOOP ON</b><br>
<b>SAM LOOP OFF</b><br>
<i>instructions: toggle repetition of a sample</i><br>
<b>Sam Loop On</b><br>
<b>Sam Loop Off</b></p>

<p>
There are many instances where a single sample needs to be repeated over and over again. SAM
LOOP ON ensures that all sound samples which follow this instruction will be looped
continuously. To turn off the looping facility, simply call the SAM LOOP OFF command. Add a
SAM LOOP ON instruction to the last example, before the SAM RAW command, and hear the
result.</p>

<p><b>Double buffered sampling</b><br>

Samples are ideal for generating realistic sound effects directly from AMOS Professional
programs. However, as the samples get longer, their memory requirements become prohibitive!
If sound samples are used sparingly, several seconds of perfect audio effects can be conjured up
by an unexpanded Amiga. Unfortunately, continuous soundtracks would seem like an
impossibility, with one minute of digital sound consuming almost a megabyte of data!</p>

<p>
Owners of the basic Amiga machine will be forced to use most memory for routines and screens,
but AMOS Professional can offer hard drive users an alternative sampling technique, allowing
the entire disc to be treated as "virtual" memory. This means that instead of loading an entire
sound sample as a single block, it can be played a section at a time directly from disc. The only
limitation to the size of such samples is the amount of free space in the storage facility.</p>

<p>
The principle of Double Buffered Sampling is very similar to the display system employed by
the screen Double Buffer. It works by storing two sample banks in memory, the physical and
the logical sample banks.</p>

<p>
The physical bank holds the sample which is currently being played through your loudspeakers,
and the logical bank contains the sample that is being loaded from disc.</p>

<p>
At the beginning of a program, the physical and logical banks are loaded with the first two
blocks of sample data. The physical sample can then be played with a SAM RAW command, and
whenever the physical bank runs out of information, the banks are swapped over to create a
seamless audio signal. The logical bank now becomes the physical bank, and vice versa.</p>

<p>
AMOS Professional provides three powerful commands used to control this process directly.
SAM SWAP activates double buffered sampling, SLOAD loads a specific section of the sample
file in memory, and the SAM SWAPPED function checks for the need to load a new block of
sample data.</p>

<p>Here is the procedure for using double buffered sampling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reserve two memory banks in CHIP Ram, to hold the logical and physical samples. The size of
      these banks will depend on the playback frequency, and the amount of background graphics</li>
</ul>
