<h1>Playing Music Modules</h1>

<br>

<p>Obviously, by setting up a simple loop, you can fade your music up or down.</p>

<p><b>TEMPO</b><br>
<i>instruction: change the speed of a piece of music</i><br>
<b>Tempo</b> speed</p>

<p>
Changing the volume or speed of music and sound effects can enhance the mood of most
programs. The TEMPO command is used to modify the speed of the current melody, and must
be followed by a number ranging from 1 for as slow as possible, up to 100 for incredibly fast.
Here is an example of music mood changing:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Examples:Music/Music.Abk"
   Music 1
   Do
    For X=0 To 63
     Tempo X: Mvolume X
    Wait 10: Next X
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
Please note that music created using the Tracker and MED systems may include their own
tempo and volume labels, and these will override the settings specified by AMOS Professional.</p>

<p><b>Playing Tracker modules</b><br>

If you are unable or unwilling to write your own musical masterpieces, there is no need to
worry. AMOS Professional lets you take other composers' soundtracks and add them to your
original games and utilities. There are thousands of public domain soundtracks written with
various systems, and to make life easy, you are provided with a range of commands that will
play the latest Soundtracker modules.</p>

<p>
A Tracker module can only be played while all other AMOS Professional music is stopped. The
following TRACKER instructions should only be used for Tracker modules and not for normal
AMOS Professional music, otherwise some bizarre noises are likely to be generated. The AMOS
Professional VOLUME and TEMPO commands will have no effect on Tracker modules, which
have their own built-in controls.</p>

<p><b>TRACK LOAD</b><br>
<i>instruction: load a Tracker module</i><br>
<b>Track Load</b> "modulename",bank number</p>

<p>
Use this command to load a specified Tracker module into the memory bank number of your
choice. Any existing data in this bank will be erased before the module is loaded, and the new
bank will be called "Tracker".</p>

<p><b>TRACK PLAY</b><br>
<i>instruction: play a Tracker module</i><br>
<b>Track Play</b><br>
<b>Track Play</b> bank number,pattern number</p>
