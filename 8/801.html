<h1>Music</h1>

<br>

<p>
This Chapter explains how to exploit the superb sound capabilities of the Amiga. It will deal
with simple sound effects and the use of music in AMOS Professional programs.</p>

<p>
Generally, the sound capabilities of a television set are terrible. To release the full potential of
AMOS Professional stereo sound, a hi-fi system or personal stereo should first be connected to
the Amiga's pair of stereo phono sockets.</p>

<p>
All AMOS Professional sound commands operate independently from games and utility
routines, so that they can never interfere with your programming. On the contrary, they should
enhance your work in any way that you chose, acting as markers, adding realism, soothing,
shocking or providing comic relief.</p>

<p><b>Ready-made sound effects</b><br>

Any imaginable sound effect can be used in an AMOS Professional program, whether it is
natural, synthetic, pre-recorded or composed by you. In fact the choice is so vast that the next
two Chapters are devoted to the wonders of sound samples! A whole bank of pre-recorded
effects has been prepared for your use, but there are three common sound effects that can
be called up by their own commands and used for testing and punctuating your routines.</p>

<p><b>BOOM</b><br>
<i>instruction: generate explosive sound effect</i><br>
<b>Boom</b></p>

<p>
By making use of interrupts to simulate "white noise", the BOOM command plays a realistic
explosive sound effect. This does not delay the program at all, so it may be necessary to use
WAIT between successive explosions, or to create ricochet and echo effects For example:</p>

<pre>
E> Curs Off : Centre "Thunderbolt and Lightning"
   Flash 1, "(FFF,1)(000,147)(A5F,2)
   Boom : Wait 150: Boom : Cls
   Centre "Very Very Frightening"
   Wait 50 : Boom
</pre>

<p><b>SHOOT</b><br>
<i>instruction: generate percussive sound effect</i><br>
<b>Shoot</b></p>

<p>
The SHOOT command generates a simple sound effect in exactly the same way as BOOM. For
example:</p>

<pre>
E> Shoot : Wait 25: Shoot : Print "Ouch!"
</pre>

<p><b>BELL</b><br>
<i>instruction: generate pure tone</i><br>
<b>Bell</b><br>
<b>Bell</b> pitch</p>

<p>Unlike the built-in explosive sound effects, BELL produces a simple pure tone.</p>
