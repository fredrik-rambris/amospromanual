<h1>Music</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Playing notes</b></p>

<p><b>PLAY</b><br>
<i>instruction: play a voice</i><br>
<b>Play</b> pitch,delay<br>
<b>Play</b> voice,pitch,delay</p>

<p><b>PLAY OFF</b><br>
<i>instruction: stop a voice playing</i><br>
<b>Play Off</b></p>

<p>
Patterns of individual notes can be played, allocated to any voice, given a pitch and delayed for
pause, using just one PLAY command.</p>

<p>
The voice parameter is optional, allowing notes to be played through any combination of the
Amiga's four voices, and is set by the usual bit-map format.</p>

<p>
The pitch parameter uses the values from 1 to 96, which correspond to the notes in the table
given earlier. Delay sets the length of any pause between this PLAY command and the next
instruction in the program, with a value of zero starling the note and immediately going on to
the next command.</p>

<p>The next example demonstrates this technique, including stereo harmonies:</p>

<pre>
E> Play 1,40,0: Play 2,50,0: Rem No delay
   Wait Key
   Play 1,40,15: Play 2,50,15: Rem Delay
   Rem Play a random sequence of notes
   Do
    V=Rnd(1 5): P=Rnd(96): Play V,P,3
   Loop
</pre>

<p>
PLAY is not restricted to pure notes. It is possible to assign complex wave forms to voices, using
the WAVE and NOISE commands, which are explained next. To stop the playing process,
simply turn it off like this:</p>

<pre>
D> Play Off
</pre>

<p><b>Making waves</b><br>

Every individual sound has its own identity pattern, which is the equivalent of an audio
fingerprint. This is because each sound is composed of its own unique frequencies. In the same
way that a hospital monitor displays a moving "wave" which pulses in lime to the frequencies of
a heartbeat, different sounds create their own wave forms. For example, a cymbal crash has a
wave form of jagged peaks very close together, whereas the smooth harmonics of a cello make
much more rounded waves.</p>
