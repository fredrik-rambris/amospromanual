sample waiting for the automatic switching operation. In this case, there is no need to load any
further information into memory.</p>

<p>
<b>1</b> means that the sample player has run out of data, and that the sample swapping operation has
failed. You will now need to re-initialise the sample from the beginning, using a SAM RAW
command. If this value is repeatedly given, your logical and physical sample banks are probably
too small. Try increasing their size to the next sensible value.</p>

<p>
The SAM SWAPPED function should be called at regular intervals while the sample is being
played. It can be used as part of the main program loop, or called automatically after a set
period, using the EVERY command.</p>

<p>Here is a typical listing, that demonstrates how these commands should be used:</p>

<pre>
X> Reserve As Chip Work 10,10000
   Reserve As Chip Work 11,10000
   Open In 1, "Dh0:Name_of a_big_sample"
   L=Lof(1) : C=0 : A=Start(10)
   Sload 1 To Start(10),10000 : C=C+10000
   Sload 1 To Start(11),10000 : C=C+10000
   Sam Raw %1111,Start(10),10000,10000
   Do
    Gosub CHECK_SAM
    If C>L Then Goto FINI
    Sam Swap %1111 To Start(11),10000
    Sload 1 To Start(10),10000 : C=C+10000
    Gosub CHECK SAM
    If C>L Then Goto FINI
    Sam Swap %1111 To Start(10),10000 : C=C+10000
    Sload 1 To Start(11),10000
   Loop
   CHECK_SAM:
   Repeat
    A=Sam Swapped(1)
    Locate 0,0: Print A;" "
   Until A=-1
   Return
   FINI:
   Close 1: End
