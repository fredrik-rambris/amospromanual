<h1>Samples</h1>

<br>

<p><b>Changing a sample bank</b><br>

Digital sound samples are normally stored in memory bank 5, but there are no restrictions on
assigning other banks to hold samples.</p>

<p><b>SAM BANK</b><br>
<i>instruction: change the current sample bank</i><br>
<b>Sam Bank</b> bank number</p>

<p>
The SAM BANK instruction dictates that all future SAM PLAY commands will take samples
from the newly specified memory bank. If several parallel banks are set up, AMOS Professional
can swap between them with a simple call to the SAM BANK command. To hear all of the
samples used in one of the AMOS Professional example games, load the following file and listen
to what is stored in the memory bank, using this routine:</p>

<pre>
E> Load "AMOSPro_Productivity:Wonderland/Wonderland Samples.Abk"
   Sam Bank 6
   For A=1 To 5
    Print "Sample number ";A
    For B=1 To 3
     Sam Play A
     Wait 20
    Next B
   Next A
</pre>

<p><b>Playing a sample from memory</b><br>

Samples do not have to be held in a special bank. In fact, a "raw" sound sample can be stored
anywhere in the computer's memory using BLOAD, and then played with the following
command:</p>

<p><b>SAM RAW</b><br>
<i>instruction: play a raw sample from memory</i><br>
<b>Sam Raw</b> voice,address,length,frequency</p>

<p>
SAM RAW plays a raw sample, and can be used to scan through any program or sound library
discs, searching for a sample that matches the given parameters.</p>

<p>
The voice parameter has already been explained. Address refers to the location address of the
sound sample, which is normally inside an AMOS Professional memory bank, but can be
anywhere. The length parameter confirms the length in bytes of the sample to be played.
Finally, frequency dictates the playback speed of the original sample, given in Hertz.</p>

<p>A typical raw sample command looks like this:</p>

<pre>
E> Reserve as work 10,21480
   R$="AMOSPro_Examples:Samples/Mixture.Abk"
   Bload R$,Start(10)
   Sam Raw 15,Start(10),length(10),3000
</pre>
