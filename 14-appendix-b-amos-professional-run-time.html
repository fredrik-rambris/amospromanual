    <h1>App. B: AMOS Professional Run Time</h1>


    <p>
        AMOS Professional has no need for a different run-only version of the main AMOS Professional
        system, and this Chapter explains the simplicity of creating run-only discs.</p>

    <p>
        If you are familiar with the original AMOS system, you may be expecting to find the AMOS
        Professional equivalent of the separate run-only version of AMOS, called RAMOS. This allows
        you to run AMOS programs completely independently from the AMOS package, but with
        AMOS Professional there is no necessity for RAMOS at all!</p>

    <p>
        AMOS Professional can be regarded as three interlinked programs, namely the Editor, the
        Monitor and the Interpreter. Obviously, the main element is the Interpreter, "AMOSPro".
        The Interpreter can be called along with the name of a program, without the Editor or Monitor,
        like this:</p>

    <img alt="AmosPro Name.AMOS"
         src="images/1417amos.jpg"/>

    <p>
        The program will be loaded along with the Interpreter, and executed. When the program has
        been run, AMOS Professional will look for the "AMOSPro.Editor" file in the APSystem folder. If
        it is found, the Editor will be loaded into memory. If the file is not found, you will be brought
        back to the Workbench.</p>

<section id="01-run-only-discs">
    <h2>Run-only discs</h2>
    <p>
        To create a run-only disc, simply copy your AMOSPro System disc, and remove the following
        files from the APSystem folder:</p>

    <pre>
AMOSPro.Editor
AMOSPro.Editor_Config
AMOSPro.Monitor
AMOSPro.Monitor_Resource
</pre>

    <p>
        Please note that when booting, if AMOS Professional finds the "Autoexec.AMOS" file in the
        current directory, this program will be run before the Editor is loaded.</p>

    <p>
        Because the Editor is a separate program, the Interpreter is not only able to work without it, but
        can also load it when a program is over, if necessary.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-kill-editor">KILL EDITOR</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: remove the AMOS Professional Editor from memory</i><br>
        <b>Kill Editor</b></p>

    <p>The KILL EDITOR command unloads the AMOS Professional Editor from memory.</p>

    <p>
        In order for this command to operate, it must be enabled in the Interpreter configuration file.
        Also, please note that the current program cannot be an accessory if KILL EDITOR is to work
        and the program cannot be a program that has been PRUNed by another program. Otherwise,
        for all other programs, the following operations are performed when KILL EDITOR is called:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A "warm start" procedure is executed, saving the configuration of all programs currently in
            memory.
        </li>
        <li>This configuration and the current program is left in memory, but all other programs are
            erased.
        </li>
        <li>All Editor buffers and Editor programs are also removed from memory, leaving a run-only
            memory configuration.
        </li>
        <li>When the program is over, AMOS Professional will re-load the Editor with all of the data
            concerning the last session, which may take a little time, but which will return you to exactly
            the same status as before KILL EDITOR was called!
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Remember that Kill Editor must be enabled from the [Set Editor] option in the [Config] menu for
        it to work.</p>

    <p>
        You are reminded that the PRG STATE function can be used to establish how a particular
        program was run. PRG STATE returns the current status of a program in the form of one of
        three possible values.</p>

    <pre>
<b>Value               Meaning</b>
 0                  The program was run under the AMOS Professional Interpreter
 1                  The program was run under a run-time environment
-1                  The program has been compiled
</pre>
