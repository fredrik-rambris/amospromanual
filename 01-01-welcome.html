<h1>Welcome</h1>

<section id="amos-professional">
    <h2>AMOS Professional</h2>
    <p>Welcome to AMOS Professional, the dedicated creation system for producing
        professional Amiga programs. With this system at your fingertips, you can
        exploit the full potential of your computer, and release the full creativity
        of your own imagination. There is not a single style of best-selling computer
        game that cannot be produced with AMOS Professional, and by reading through
        this User Guide and examining the hundreds of ready-made examples on disc,
        you will soon discover that all of the hard work has been done for you.</p>


    <p>AMOS Professional has evolved over several years until it can now provide
        beginners and experts alike with full control over superb graphics,
        animation, audio sampling, synthetic speech, menus, interactive control
        panels, and above all, ideas! Most importantly, you can customise AMOS
        Professional to suit all your own needs, quickly, simply and precisely.</p>


    <p>If you get into any sort of trouble, AMOS Professional offers instant
        on-screen Help with every command and aspect of your programming, and there
        is even a built-in Program Monitor to examine what is happening within your
        routines.</p>


    <p>Experienced AMOS users will be amazed how many new features and
        improvements have been added to the original system. Beginners will probably
        take it all for granted!</p>

<section id="01-how-to-exploit-this-user-guide">
    <h2>How to exploit this User Guide</h2>

    <p>A system that has been designed to satisfy all Amiga programming needs must
        offer its facilities clearly and simply, otherwise the sheer scale of the
        package can seem overwhelming, and some of the system's wonders may be
        completely overlooked by the user. To make this User Guide as helpful as
        possible, it has been divided into a series of self-contained Sections, and
        each Section deals with a specific aspect of the AMOS Professional system.
        Where these Sections cover several related subjects, each subject is examined
        in its own Chapter.</p>


    <p>However, the printed word can never convey the look and feel of a
        programming technique, which is why everything that you read in these pages
        can also be demonstrated and analysed on screen, at the touch of a button!
        AMOS Professional comes complete with pre-programmed instant examples of
        everything from a single command to complete arcade games, strategy
        simulations and practical utilities!</p>


    <p>Normally, you will be able to call for ready-made demonstrations and Help
        directly, but where it is necessary to load a particular demonstration
        program from a disc, a special pointer symbol is used in this User Guide.
        Similar pointers also appear to make it clear which examples you can type
        in.</p>

    <br>

    <p>There are four different pointers that can appear at the
        left-hand side of the page, and they have the following meanings:</p>


    <p>DP&gt; Disc Pointer. Please load this ready-made demonstration program
        from disc.<br></p>

    <p>E &gt; Edit Pointer. This printed example can be typed in
        exactly as it appears on the page, from the AMOS Professional Edit Screen. It can
        then be Run, and is seen on screen.</p>

    <p>D&gt; Direct Mode Pointer. This printed example can be
        typed in exactly as it appears on<br>
        the page, from the AMOS Professional Direct Mode Window. It can then be
        demonstrated by pressing the [Return] key.</p>

    <p>X&gt; This printed example demonstrates a particular
        programming technique
        or part of a routine. There is no need to type it in, because it cannot
        be
        demonstrated in isolation on the screen.</p>

    <p>Printed examples of AMOS Professional programs appear in
        special type, and
        they are indented on the page like this:</p>
<code class="prefix edit">
AMOS=1
Print AMOS
</code>

    <p>AMOS Professional provides over seven hundred command words
        ready to be exploited in your own programming routines, and many of them are
        staggeringly powerful. Because these command words are so important, they are
        printed in prominent type throughout this User Guide. When they appear in the main
        body of the text, they are printed in capital letters. For example the
        simple command word for printing items appears as PRINT. Where a command word
        is introduced for the first time in the User Guide, it is indented on the
        page and printed in large bold type, along with a summary of its use. For
        example:</p>

    <p><b>PRINT</b><br>
        <i>instruction: print items on screen</i><br>
        <b>Print</b> items</p>

    <p>Everything else is fully explained as it is introduced, or is
        completely self-explanatory. Now that AMOS Professional has been introduced to
        you, and before introducing AMOS Professional to your Amiga, here are a few
        words of welcome from some of the key players in the team.</p>
</section>

    <p align="right">FRAN&Ccedil;OIS LIONET</p><br>

    <p>
        Is it really five years since two French guys visited our offices with
        STOS Basic in tow? It had
        sold a couple of thousand units in France and all its support programs
        looked terrible! But there
        was something magical under the hood: STOS had an amazingly fast
        sprite engine, a powerful
        music facility, and it was perfect for writing games. We got incredibly
        excited, decided to publish STOS in the UK as The Games Creator, and
        got the author to write a Low res sprite editor and a game, for which
        we supplied all the graphics. STOS was transformed! It was launched in
        August 1988 and stormed straight to Number One in the Gallup Charts. It
        has since sold 40,000 copies through the shops, and a further 90,000
        when Atari bundled it with the ST for a year.<br>

        AMOS was started soon after the STOS launch. Until then,
        Fran&ccedil;ois had hardly seen an Amiga,
        and boy, did he have problems coming to terms with its idiosyncrasies!
        Since then, AMOS has
        transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Amiga programmers!
        Easy AMOS followed
        on, to meet the demands of first-time programmers. Fran&ccedil;ois made so
        many improvements to
        the original environment that we had to give AMOS a complete overhaul,
        and the result is
        AMOS Professional: what must be the most sophisticated development
        system for the Amiga
        yet.

        I am sure that as you use AMOS Pro you will appreciate the sheer
        amount of hard work and
        love that Fran&ccedil;ois, Richard, Mel, Stephen, Ronnie and the
        team have put into the package. They
        have worked long hours, seven days a week to bring you their pride and
        joy, based on
        conversations and questionnaires from very many AMOS users. I hope that
        this is exactly what
        you've been waiting for, and I wish you many happy hours using AMOS Pro
        to transform your dreams into reality.</p>

    <p align="right">CHRIS PAYNE</p><br>

    <p>I've been involved with AMOS from the very beginning. It's been a
        wonderful program to work
        with and I have always been excited by each new version created by
        Fran&ccedil;ois. With AMOS
        Professional we have turned the tables on you, the user. Instead of
        dictating what this new
        version was to be, we contacted over two hundred AMOS enthusiasts to
        see what they wanted.
        From their replies we created a Wish List of major features.
        The ones that made the most sense
        and offered the greatest benefits to the majority of users were grafted
        into the system. AMOS is
        a very wholesome product, and it leaves no boulders unturned. Its
        creative powers allow you to
        produce endless types of programs. Have strength in all your
        programming efforts, and if your
        human machine tries to defeat you and you feel like giving up, rely on
        the strength of AMOS
        Professional. The satisfaction is well worth the effort. Go for it!</p>

    <p>I remember my first glimpse of AMOS Basic, three years ago. A
        package popped through my
        letter box containing a three-and-a-half-inch disc bearing the label
        AMOS-1 written in biro. Ten
        minutes later I was completely hooked! All through the next year, new
        versions arrived on my
        welcome mat, and I never quite knew what to expect. It was like opening
        Christmas presents
        every week! There were many surprises along the way, including the AMAL
        animation language, but the potential of the system was obvious from that first
        disc. As the project drew to a close, I resolved to get down to some
        serious AMOS programming. Three years and several
        hundred programs later, I'm still raring to go!</p>

    <p>It looks like Christmas has arrived early this year, and I'm
        even more enthusiastic about AMOS
        Professional. It heralds an exciting new chapter in the world of Amiga
        programming, and I'm
        delighted to be part of it. There are dozens of great new features, and
        I have already
        programmed each and every one of them. AMOS has provided me with years
        of enjoyment,
        and AMOS Professional promises more to come. So join me on an extended
        journey into the
        fascinating world of AMOS Programming. you won't regret it!</p>

    <p>When I first became interested in computers, they were an
        unknown quantity. Friends would
        ask me, "What can you do with a computer?", and there I was for six
        hours a night with my
        ZX80, 1k RAM, no colour, no sound, no graphics, writing 101 different
        programs that printed
        my name to the screen. At the time I didn't have an answer to their
        questions.
        About twenty years have passed since I plugged in my first transformer,
        and home computers
        have evolved into powerful and complex beasts. AMOS Professional is the
        tamer of my beast,
        and with a little effort on your part, I'm sure it will become one of
        your best friends as well.
        Since using the AMOS system, I have the perfect answer to the old
        question "What can you do
        with a computer?" I simply reply, "Anything I like!"</p>


    <p align="right">RONNIE SIMPSON</p><br>

    <p>
        I was a computing crustacean: a creature with an interesting past and
        possibly extinct. I evolved
        from the digital slime when computers were as big as a whale and as
        daft as plankton. Two
        years ago They said to me "This is an Amiga, and this is Easy AMOS. If
        someone like you can
        understand how the two go together, then anyone can!" I understood. I
        evolved. There were
        only three things wrong with Easy AMOS: it was sleeker, smarter and
        friendlier than its big
        brother AMOS. So now They have come up with AMOS Professional. I can
        understand this too.
        I have evolved some more. <br>

        Now I'm a computing dolphin: streamlined,
        intelligent, well-loved
        and a protected species. Thanks everyone.</p>
