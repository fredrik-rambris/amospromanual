    <h1>Accessing a Serial Port</h1>


    <p>
        Here is the Chapter which explains how AMOS Professional is used as the gateway to the world
        of computerised communications.</p>

    <p>
        The I/O Extension provides you with all the commands needed to exploit the Amiga's serial port
        for the following purposes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Long-distance multi-user games played between any number of Amiga users.</li>
        <li>Network communications between desks, offices, classrooms and continents!</li>
        <li>MIDI interfacing for musicians, between the Amiga and synthesizers, drum machines and
            sequencers.
        </li>
    </ul>

<section id="01-opening-the-serial-port">
    <h2>Opening the Serial Port</h2>
    <p>
        A serial device refers to any machine that can communicate with the Amiga via its Serial Port.
        These devices include modems, MIDI systems and of course, other Amigas.</p>

    <p>
        <i>instruction: open a channel for Serial Input/Output</i><br>
        <b>Serial Open</b> Channel number,Port number<br>
        <b>Serial Open</b> Channel number, Port number,Shared,Xmode,7wires</p>

    <p>
        The SERIAL OPEN command is used to open a communication channel between the Amiga and
        a serial device. The following parameters can be given with this instruction:</p>

    <p>
        The Channel number is an identification number that will be used for <b>all</b> subsequent
        communication commands. The values for this number range from zero to 3.</p>

    <p>
        The Port number is normally set to zero, and it specifies the logical device number of the Serial
        Port. For Amigas equipped with a Multi-Serial card that offers additional Serial Ports, these extra
        ports can be accessed by specifying a Port number from 1 upwards.</p>

    <p>There are three optional parameters that can also be given, as follows:</p>

    <p>
        The Shared parameter refers to a value which acts as a flag, telling AMOS Professional that the
        serial device can be shared with other tasks that are currently running on the computer. In other
        words, this parameter is used for multi-tasking. A value of zero (False) will grab the specified
        channel for AMOS Professional programs, and will deny access to any other programs. A value
        of -1 (True) will allow the Serial Port to be shared between several programs in memory. You are
        warned to use this system with great care, to avoid crashing your Amiga.</p>

    <p>
        The Xmode is a val.-Lie which is used to toggle the checking system known as XON/XOFF. This
        system makes checks during the transmission of data over a serial line. It is essential to set this
        flag when the device is first opened, even if the device will not be required until later. The
        default value is zero (False), and this means that the system is normally disabled. To enable the
        checking system, a value of -1 (True) must be set. Once the port has been opened, the XON and
        XOFF characters must be set using a SERIAL X command, which is explained later.</p>

    <p>
        The last of the three optional parameters concerns the "7 wires system" of communication.
        The default value for this parameter is set to zero (False), and a value of -1 (True)
        tells the device to use this system.</p>


    <p>
        When the SERIAL OPEN command is called for the first time, the Serial Device library is loaded
        from the System disc automatically, so make sure that this disc is available in the current drive.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-close">SERIAL CLOSE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: close one or more Serial channels</i><br>
        <b>Serial Close</b><br>
        <b>Serial Close</b> Channel number</p>

    <p>
        The use of this instruction closes all currently opened serial channels with no check for any
        errors. If an optional channel number is given, the specified channel will be closed using all
        normal error checks.</p>

    <p>
        Whenever a program is run from AMOS Professional, any opened channels will be closed
        automatically.</p>
</section>

<section id="02-setting-the-serial-parameters">
    <h2>Setting the serial parameters</h2>
    <p>
        The default settings for Serial Channels correspond to the standard Minitel protocol used in
        France, as follows:</p>

    <pre>
1200 Baud
7 bits
1 stop bit
Even parity.
</pre>

    <p>These settings can be changed using the instructions that are explained next.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-speed">SERIAL SPEED</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set transfer rate for a serial channel</i><br>
        <b>Serial Speed</b> Channel number,Baud rate</p>

    <p>
        This sets the current data transfer rate (the Baud rate) of the given channel, for both the sending
        and receiving operations. A Baud rate cannot be split for a. single channel. If the specified
        transfer rate is not supported by the current serial device, it may be rejected by the system.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-bits">SERIAL BITS</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set the number of bits for transmission of characters</i><br>
        <b>Serial Bits</b> Channel number,number of bits,number of Stop bits</p>

    <p>
        This command is used to assign the number of bits that are to be used for each character that is
        transmitted. After the channel number is specified, give the number of bits followed by the
        number of Stop bits to be used.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-parity">SERIAL PARITY</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set parity checking for a serial channel</i><br>
        <b>Serial Parity</b> Channel number, Parity</p>

    <p>
        The SERIAL PARITY instruction sets the parity checking to be used for the specified
        serial channel.</p>


    <p>Here is a list of the available settings for the Parity parameter:</p>

    <pre>
-1 No parity
0  Even parity
1  Odd parity
2  Space parity
3  Mark parity
</pre>


    <p>This Parity bit may be set using the BSET or BCLR instructions, as follows:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">P=0 : Bset 0,P: <comment>Rem Odd parity</comment>
Bclr 1,P : <comment>Rem Normal parity</comment>
Serial Parity 1,P : <comment>Rem Set parity using the value in P</comment>
</code>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-x">SERIAL X</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set handshaking system of serial channel</i><br>
        <b>Serial X</b> Channel number,Xmode</p>

    <p>
        This command is used to enable or disable the XON/XOFF handshaking system, which checks
        data transmission. A value of -1 (True) will disable the system, whereas any other value will turn
        it on. The Xmode parameter should be loaded with the correct control characters, which must be
        specified in the following format:</p>

<code class="prefix ex">Xmode=XON110000000+XOFF*$1000</code>
</section>

<section id="03-sending-and-receiving-serial-information">
    <h2>Sending and receiving Serial information</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-send">SERIAL SEND</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: output a string via a serial channel</i><br>
        <b>Serial Send</b> Channel number,string</p>

    <p>
        This is used to send the given string directly to the selected serial channel, without waiting
        for the data to be transmitted through the actual port. This means that the SERIAL CHECK
        function must be used to detect when the transmission of data has been completed, and this is
        explained below.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-out">SERIAL OUT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: output a block of raw data via a serial channel</i><br>
        <b>Serial Out</b> Channel number,address,length</p>

    <p>
        This command is identical to SERIAL SEND, except for the fact that it works with raw data,
        instead of a string. Specify the channel number as usual, followed by the address in memory of
        the data to be transmitted, and the length of the data given in the number of bytes to be sent.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-serial-get">SERIAL GET</h3>
    <p><i>function: get a byte from a serial device</i><br>
        value=<b>Serial Get</b>(Channel number)</p>

    <p>
        To read a single byte from a serial device, use the SERIAL GET function and
        specify which channel is to be examined. If no data is available,
        a value of -1 will be returned.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="fn-serial-input-dollar">SERIAL INPUT$</h3>
    <p><i>function: get a string from the Serial Port</i><br>
        string=<b>Serial Input$</b>(Channel number)</p>

    <p>
        This function is used to read an entire string of characters from the Serial Port. If no data is
        available an empty string will be returned, otherwise the string will contain all the bytes that
        have been transmitted via the serial line up to the present moment.</p>

    <p>
        Care should be taken when using this function with high speed transfers, such as those from
        MIDI devices. If the waiting time between each receive is too long, the system may overload and
        generate errors such as "string too long" or "serial device buffer overrun".</p>

    <p>
        Transmitting a very large string can take a long time, especially at low Baud rates. With AMOS
        Professional multi-tasking, a program will only continue after a SERIAL SEND instruction. To
        avoid corrupting data, the following system should be employed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use the SERIAL CHECK function before using lengthy strings.</li>
        <li>Perform a "garbage collection" using X =FREE, to ensure that the program will not provoke
            such an operation spontaneously.
        </li>
        <li>Use the SERIAL OUT command and set the address parameter to contain the location of a
            memory bank that has been previously reserved.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="04-other-serial-commands">
    <h2>Other Serial commands</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-buf">SERIAL BUF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: set the size of the serial buffer</i><br>
        <b>Serial Buffer</b> Channel number,length</p>

    <p>
        This allocates the length of the buffer space for the required channel, specified in the number of
        bytes to be allocated. The minimum allocation is 64 bytes, and the default setting is 512 bytes.
        You are recommended to increase the buffersize for high speed transfers of data.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-fast">SERIAL FAST</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: engage fast mode for data transfer</i><br>
        <b>Serial Fast</b> Channel number</p>

    <p>
        Use this command to set a special "fast" flag in the current serial device, which disables much of
        the internal checking process that can slow down the communication process. This is
        recommended for high speed transfers. Please note that when SERIAL FAST is called, the
        protocol is changed to: even parity, no XON/XOFF and 8 bits.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-slow">SERIAL SLOW</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: re-set slow mode for data transfer</i><br>
        <b>Serial Slow</b> Channel number</p>

    <p>
        This instruction slows the serial device transmission back to normal speed, and all of the internal
        error checks are enabled once more.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="fn-serial-check">SERIAL CHECK</h3>
    <p><i>function: report current serial device activity</i><br>
        status=<b>Serial Check</b>(Channel number)</p>

    <p>
        This function obtains a report on the status of the current serial device. It can be used to check
        whether all of the information to be transmitted by a previous SERIAL SEND command has
        been sent. If a value of zero (False) is returned, the last Serial command is still being executed. If
        the value is -1 (True) the transmission has been completed.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-serial-status">SERIAL STATUS</h3>
    <p><i>function: report status of the serial port</i><br>
        bit-map=<b>Serial Status</b>(channel number)</p>

    <p>
        The SERIAL STATUS function provides detailed information concerning the current status of
        the serial port. The channel number parameter refers to an open channel that has been
        previously assigned to the serial port with a SERIAL OPEN command. The report is returned in
        the form of a bit-map holding the status of fifteen different parameters. Here is a table of the
        various possibilities. If the relevant bit is set to the value under the "Active" column, the
        associated status has been successfully detected. Any other value indicates that the option is
        currently idle.</p>

    <pre>
<b>Bit   Active    Status</b>
0       -       Reserved
1       -       reserved
2       1       Parallel "select" for A1000 machines. For the A500 and A2000,"select" is
                also connected to the serial port "Ring Indicator".
3       0       DSR (Data Set Ready)
4       0       CTS (Clear To Send)
5       0       Carrier Detect
6       0       RTS (Ready To Send)
7       0       DTR (Data terminal Ready)
8       1       Hardware overru
9       1       Break sent (most recent output)
10      1       Break received (as latest input)
11      1       Transmit x-OFF
12      1       Receive x-Off
13      -       Reserved
14      -       Reserved
15      -       Reserved
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-serial-error">SERIAL ERROR</h3>
    <p><i>function: report success of the last data transfer</i><br>
        status=<b>Serial Error</b>(Channel number)</p>

    <p>
        The SERIAL ERROR function is used to look for the Error byte in the serial device.
        A value of zero (False) confirms that all is well, whereas 4 (True) indicates
        that there was an error in the last transmission.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="i-serial-abort">SERIAL ABORT</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: stop current data transfer</i><br>
        <b>Serial Abort</b>(channel number)</p>

    <p>
        This command halts any serial operations that have been commenced by a SERIAL SEND or
        SERIAL OUT command, and leaves the channel clear. It allows an instant quit from a transfer,
        without the need to wait for current activities to be completed.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-serial-base">SERIAL BASE</h3>
    <p><i>function: get the address of the serial base</i><br>
        address=<b>Serial Base</b></p>

    <p>
        The SERIAL BASE function is especially useful for systems programmers. It returns the base
        address of the i/o structure of the current serial channel, allowing system functions to be called
        directly from an AMOS Professional program with EXEC. You are warned not to use this
        function unless you know precisely what you are doing, otherwise any mistakes can crash your
        computer.</p>
