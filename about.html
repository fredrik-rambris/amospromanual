<section id="why-this-was-created">

    <h2>Why this was created</h2>

    <p>This is the AMOS Professional manual that have been reworked for the modern web. It
        was first digitized by Asymetrix in 2008 and uploaded to Aminet and other places. However
        the HTML version was made for browsers current at that time and also closely followed how
        the paper book was laid out. This meant that navigating though the book was much like
        scanning to a chapter and then flipping pages.</p>

    <p>Asymetrix did a great job getting the manual in the hands of people no longer able to
        purchase original which has gone out of print. We owe him a great thanks.</p>

<section id="what-has-been-done">

    <h2>What has been done</h2>

    <p>What I have done is to rework the manual to be more web friendly. This means that the
        manual is now more like a website than a book. This makes it easier to navigate and
        read on modern devices. It also makes it easier to search for specific topics.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Each chapter has been merged into its own file</li>
        <li>Every section, every command has a linkable ID</li>
        <li>The command index links directly to each command</li>
        <li>The documents use more semantically correct structure, making it easier to spindle and parse</li>
        <li>The pages now flows correctly on mobile devices</li>
        <li>All screen output has been reformatted</li>
        <li>The content overview is the front page and is consistently structured</li>
        <li>All documents are valid HTML5 and use CSS for style and layout</li>
        <li>All keyboard shortcuts have been styled and looks clearer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>My name is Fredrik Rambris and got my copy of AMOS around 1991. Finally a BASIC for the Amiga
    that let the developer fully utilize all of the Amiga's powers. I have been programming since early
    childhood and in 1988 my brother brought an Amiga 500 home.</p>

    <p>Although I switched over to C and later other languages the love for AMOS is still with me.</p>
