    <h1>IFF Animation</h1>


    <p>
        This Chapter explains how AMOS Professional is capable of taking data saved in
        Interchangeable File Format (IFF), and transforming it into superb animations. Old hands and
        less experienced AMOS users alike will discover a new potential for exploiting programming
        kills.</p>

    <p>
        IFF graphics have already been discussed as sources for screen pictures and Bob images, and
        you should be familiar with the LOAD IFF and SAVE IFF commands in the relevant Screens and
        Bobs Chapters. Here is a brief reminder:</p>

    <i>instruction: load an IFF screen from a disc</i><br>
    <b>Load IFF</b> "filename"<br>
    <b>Load IFF</b> "filename",any screen number</p>

    <pre>
E> Flash Off
   Load Iff"AMOSPro Examples:Logo.Iff"
</pre>

    <p><b>SAVE IFF</b><br>
        <i>instruction: save an IFF screen</i><br>
        <b>Save Iff</b> "filename"<br>
        <b>Save Iff</b> "filename", compression flag</p>

    <pre>
X> Save Iff "My Programs:Iff/Picture_Name.Iff" : Rem Compressed
   Save Iff "My_Programs:Iff/Picture_Name.Iff",0 : Rem Uncompressed
</pre>

    <p>
        Remember that the saved IFF data includes any pre-sets such as SCREEN DISPLAY, SCREEN
        OFFSET, SCREEN HIDE and SCREEN SHOW.</p>

    <h2>Optimising IFF animation</h2>
    <p>
        It is perfectly possible to create high definition "true video" animation on your Amiga with
        AMOS Professional. Unfortunately, you are normally restricted by available memory. Smooth
        animations need to display at least 24 "frames" (separate still pictures) every second, and every
        16-colour, full-screen picture requires about 32k of storage space. This means that you would
        need to invest in a lot of expensive memory storage to run a few seconds of animation, or the
        memory of an unexpanded Amiga would be exhausted within two seconds! One solution is to
        use tiny images, reduce the number of colours and compact these images using the SPACK
        command, but the AMOS Professional programmer deserves better than that.</p>

    <p>
        Adapting the "delta-encoding" technique from the latest video research, AMOS Professional is
        able to optimise IFF data, concentrating on those parts of the image that actually appear to
        "move", and disregarding the much larger area of the screen that remains more or less the same.
        So instead of needing to store a long sequence of complete images, only the differences between
        one image and the next are recorded. This only requires a fraction of the conventional storage
        space and as a bonus it means that data can be unpacked extremely quickly.</p>

</section>

<section id="02-an-overview-of-iff-animation">
    <h2>An overview of IFF animation</h2>
    <p>
        AMOS Professional IFF animation files are divided into a number of separate components, the
        "frames" of your animation sequence. A frame may be either a normal screen or one image in
        the sequence, but it is important to understand that the first frame sets up the background
        reference image for the entire animation, and this first frame is a standard IFF picture. All of the
        following frames are then stored using the delta-encoding system, to be saved as a list of the
        differences between the new image and the current display.</p>

    <p>
        AMOS Professional offers several alternative methods of exploiting your animations, which may
        be displayed as an entire sequential video in a single operation, or played in any combination of
        frames, providing the sequence runs forwards. Maximum use is made of the double buffering
        system, to ensure smooth screen displays, although you are free to ignore this feature and
        summon up some flickering screen effects.</p>

    <p>
        IFF animation can be used directly with most other AMOS Professional graphics commands,
        including SCREEN COPY and SCROLL, and you can experiment with any area that is not being
        currently animated. Obviously, if you try to draw over the area of the animation, the display will
        become corrupted. It should also be noted that IFF animation is not compatible with the
        standard Bob routines. When using Bobs, it is safe to hide the IFF animation on an invisible
        background screen and copy the results to the main display. Please see <a href="07-03-updating-objects.html">Chapter 7.3</a> for an
        explanation of updating objects. Of course, the easiest solution is to bypass the problem entirely
        and use sprites instead of Bobs!</p>

    <p>
        It is important to remember that IFF animations can only be played forwards. Never attempt to
        run your frames in reverse order. A special function is provided for skipping over any frames
        you want to miss out.</p>

    <p>
        You should be aware that even with delta-encoding, large, colourful and lengthy animations
        will still consume huge amounts of memory, but AMOS Professional can release this memory
        ready for re-use, as you are about to discover.</p>

<section id="03-creating-an-iff-animation">
    <h2>Creating an IFF animation</h2>
    <p>
        Many hours can be spent in the creative art of designing home-grown IFF pictures, and
        adapting them for animation sequences. On the other hand, you can cheat! If a video digitiser is
        beyond your budget there are plenty of public domain images to be found, but the most flexible
        method is to use commercial packages like Deluxe Paint. III or IV. AMOS Professional uses
        compressed" (Mode 5) animations, which should be selected from the menu of a commercially
        available drawing package. Deluxe Paint uses this mode as a default, allowing you to draw your
        frames one by one on the screen, and then generate the necessary ANIM files automatically.
        Deluxe Paint users can produce animations using the following procedure:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Draw the background picture for Frame 1 of the animation sequence, which can be as
            complex as you wish, as it will only be stored once in the animation file.
        </li>
        <li>Select [Add Frame] from the [Frames] option on the main [Anim] menu. A new frame will be
            created, containing an exact copy of your background picture. There will now be two numbers
        </li>
    </ul>


    <ul>
        on screen indicating the number of the frame being currently edited, and the total number of
        frames in your animation sequence. Because the background picture for your animations is
        two led as frame number one, the editing process will start with frame number two.
        <li>Modify your picture using Any of the Deluxe Paint drawing commands, and when you are
            satisfied simply move on to the next frame by triggering [Add Frame] again.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this process of modifying the last frame and then adding the next frame, for as long as
            required. You can check the progress of your animated sequence by going to the
            Anim/Control] menu and clicking on [Play]. Press any key to exit from the animation.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, save your animation sequence onto disc with the [Save] option from the [Anim] menu.
            This animation can now be loaded directly into AMOS Professional Basic, and animated with
            the first command listed below.
        </li>
    </ul>

<section id="04-playing-an-iff-animation">
    <h2>Playing an IFF animation</h2>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-iff-anim">IFF ANIM</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: play an animation file</i><br>
        <b>Iff Anim</b> "filename" <b>To</b> screen number<br>
        <b>Iff Anim</b> "filename" <b>To</b> screen number, times</p>

    <p>
        This function provides the most straightforward way of displaying a complete IFF animation
        sequence directly on screen. The "filename" must refer to a valid IFF animation saved in
        "compressed" (Mode 5) format. The screen number defines the screen to be created for the
        animation sequence. If the requested screen number already exists, it will be replaced by the
        new definition automatically. There is an optional parameter to set the number of times the
        animated sequence is to be played. If this number is omitted, the animation will be played once.</p>

    <p>
        Remember that frame number 1 is the background screen that serves as the basis for the entire
        sequence, so that your animation will always re-start from frame number 2.</p>

    <p>
        After the animation has been played the requested number of times it will stop. The memory
        consumed will automatically be released back to AMOS Professional for re-use.</p>

    <p>
        If you have a disc containing an IFF animation file, place it into any drive and call up the
        standard file selector, like this:</p>

    <pre>
D> Iff Anim Fsel$("**") To 0,10
</pre>

    <p>
        When the file is requested, your animation sequence will be loaded into screen 0 and cycled
        through ten times.</p>
</section>

<section id="05-direct-iff-animation">
    <h2>Direct IFF animation</h2>
    <p>Because the standard AMOS Professional drawing commands may be used with IFF animations,
        you are provided with a range of functions for loading and manipulating animated sequences
        directly in your programs.</p>


    <h3 class="command" id="fn-frame-load">FRAME LOAD</h3>
    <p><i>function: load frames into memory</i><br>
        frames=<b>Frame Load</b>(channel <b>To</b> bank/address)<br>
        frames=<b>Frame Load</b>(channel <b>To</b> bank/address,number of frames)</p>

    <p>
        Use this function to load one or more IFF frames directly into memory. The parameters in
        brackets are as follows:</p>

    <p>
        The channel number is the number of an animation file that is currently opened using the
        OPEN IN command.</p>

    <p>
        Next, specify the memory address or bank number where the frames are to be stored. If an
        address is specified, the entire file will be loaded into the chosen memory area, exactly like a
        BLOAD instruction. If you give a bank number, a new memory bank will be reserved
        automatically. It will hold your animation frames and be a permanent data bank in fast memory,
        called "IFF". Please note that bank numbers can range from 1 to 65535. To avoid overrunning
        your memory area and crashing the system, it is vital that enough space is reserved to hold the
        entire animation sequence in memory. The actual storage requirements may be calculated with
        the FRAME LENGTH function, which is explained later.</p>

    <p>
        Finally, there is an optional parameter that specifies the number of animation frames to be
        loaded. If this number is omitted, only Frame 1 will be loaded, but if your request is greater than
        the total number of available frames, all of the images will be grabbed in the current file, if
        memory allows. This can be exploited to load entire sequences no matter what their length, by
        setting this optional parameter to an overlarge number, as no error will be generated.</p>

    <p>
        FRAME LOAD returns the number of frames that have been successfully loaded into memory.
        This value may be saved into a variable once the animation has been loaded, and made use of
        when the sequence is to be played. For example:</p>

    <pre>
E> Rem Open animation file for reading
   Open In 1,"AMOSPro_Tutorial:Iff_Anim/AMOS.Anim"
   Rem Load all frames in current file
   Rem use overlarge value of 1000 to grab all available images to bank 10
   N=Frame Load (1 To 10,1000)
   Close
   Rem N now holds the number of actual frames
   Print "Number of frames in this file is ";N
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-frame-length">FRAME LENGTH</h3>
    <p><i>function: return the length of frames in bytes</i><br>
        size=<b>Frame Length</b>(channel)<br>
        size=<b>Frame Length</b>(channel,number of frames)</p>

    <p>
        This function is used to calculate the precise amount of memory needed to hold the selected
        frames of an IFF animation file. To find the exact size of the required data area with FRAME</p>


    <p>
        LENGTH, simply give the channel number of the IFF file previously opened with the OPEN IN
        command.</p>

    <p>
        You may also specify the number of frames to be taken into consideration. If this number is
        omitted, only the first frame in the animation with be checked. Alternatively, if an overlarge
        number is specified, the exact memory requirements of all the frames in the current file will be
        returned.</p>

    <p>
        FRAME LENGTH does not change the position of the file pointer, but leaves it at the start of the
        next animation frame to be loaded. So it can be used immediately before a FRAME LOAD
        command to check the memory requirement of your new animation. For example:</p>

    <pre>
E> Open In 1 ,"AMOSPro_Tutorial:Iff_Anim/AMOS.Anim"
   Rem Load first frame only into memory
   L=Frame Length(1)
   Rem Reserve space for the frame in Bank 10
   Reserve As Work 10,L
   N=Frame Load(1 To 10)
   Close
   Print "Required memory for frame 1=";L
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-frame-play">FRAME PLAY</h3>
    <p><i>function: play frames on screen</i><br>
        frame=<b>Frame Play</b>(bank/address,number)<br>
        frame=<b>Frame Play</b>(bank/address,number,screen)</p>

    <p>
        Use this function to display animations on screen at the appropriate points in your programs.
        Specify the memory address or bank number containing an IFF animation sequence that has
        already been loaded by FRAME LOAD. Please note that addresses must be even and that the
        first bytes must be a valid IFF Frame definition. Next specify the number of frames that you
        want to play.</p>

    <p>
        The optional screen parameter is the identifier of a new screen to be created for the animation,
        and it can be used to automatically define a screen as the first frame of the animation to be
        displayed. If this screen number is omitted, an attempt will be made to use the current screen.</p>

    <p>
        Please note that your new screen will not be set up for double buffering, and you should
        activate this directly from your program with the DOUBLE BUFFER command, if required. Also,
        the IFF animation will be displayed on the logical screen, and when using double buffering
        SCREEN SWAP must be employed, otherwise the animation will run invisibly in the
        background!</p>

    <p>
        Once the FRAME PLAY function has been called, the start address of the next frame in the
        sequence will be returned, and this address can be used to display the following frame of the
        animation.</p>


    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre>
E> Rem Play the first frame in Bank 10 using screen 0
   F=Frame Play(10,1,0)
   Double Buffer : Rem activate non automatic double buffer
   Rem Display next frame
   F=Frame Play(F,1)
</pre>

    <p>
        When the end of the animation sequence has been reached, your F variable points to the last
        frame of the animation. Because the exact number of frames is returned to the FRAME LOAD
        function, FRAME PLAY can be enclosed in a loop for simplicity, like this:</p>

    <pre>
E> Open In 1,"AMOSPro_Tutorialiff_Anim/AMOS.Anim"
   L=Frame Load(1 To 10,1000)
   Close
   Rem Play first frame from Bank 0 and define new screen 0
   Do
    P=Frame Play(10,1,0)
    Double Buffer
    For X=2 To L-1 : Rem Play sequence to the end
     P=Frame Play(P,1) : Rem Play next frame
     Screen Swap : Rem Make animation visible
     Wait Vbl : Wait Vbl : Wait Vbl
    Next X
   Loop
</pre>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-frame-skip">FRAME SKIP</h3>
    <p><i>function: skip past an animation frame</i><br>
        s=<b>Frame Skip</b>(bank/address)<br>
        s=<b>Frame Skip</b>(bank/address,number)</p>

    <p>
        This is exactly the same as FRAME PLAY, except that no output is made to the screen. FRAME
        SKIP omits any selected frames and returns the address of the next frame to be played in the
        sequence. The bank or address number of a valid IFF animation frame is given, followed by the
        number of frames to be skipped over.</p>

    <p>
        Use FRAME SKIP carefully, because frames are stored relative to the existing screen background.
        This means that the animation will only re-commence when an identical frame is reached to the
        one currently being displayed.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-frame-param">FRAME PARAM</h3>
    <p><i>function: return a parameter after playing a frame</i><br>
        p=<b>Frame Param</b></p>

    <p>
        This function returns the amount of time needed to successfully display an animation on screen,
        measured in 50ths of a second. It is used after FRAME PLAY or FRAME SKIP to delay the
        program until the screen has been totally re-drawn.</p>


    <p>
        Deluxe Paint users may need to slow down the speed of AMOS Professional animations by one
        fiftieth of a second, in order to harmonise the display, like this:</p>

    <pre>
X> Wait Form Param+1
</pre>

    <p>
        This has nothing to do with the Deluxe Paint package, but takes into account the extra efficiency
        of the AMOS Professional double buffering and copper calculations, when compared to the
        standard Workbench routines!</p>
</section>

<section id="06-iff-masking">
    <h2>IFF Masking</h2>
    <p>
        AMOS Professional does not restrict you to loading all of an IFF picture file. It is possible to load
        specific parts of the file that hold such items as the palette and the bit-maps only. The PICTURE
        function is used in conjunction with the MASK IFF function to achieve this.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="fn-picture">PICTURE</h3>
    <p><i>function: return mask details of an IFF image</i><br>
        mask=<b>Picture</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-mask-iff">MASK IFF</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: mask IFF picture data</i><br>
        <b>Mask Iff</b> bit-map</p>

    <p>
        The PICTURE function returns the precise format of the mask used by a picture, and it is used
        like this:</p>

    <pre>
X> Mask Iff Picture
   Load Iff "Picture_Name"
</pre>

    <p>Here are some typical settings that can be used to load masked data from an IFF file:</p>

    <pre>
X> Mask Iff %100 : Rem Load palette of picture only
   Mask Iff %10000 : Rem Load bitmaps only
</pre>
</section>

<section id="07-freezing-the-display">
    <h2>Freezing the display</h2>
    <p>
        In the next Chapter, the AMOS Professional animation language AMAL is explained. AMAL
        animations can be frozen with an AMAL FREEZE instruction, and unfrozen with AMAL ON.
        The following commands are equivalents to these two instructions, and also offer STOS
        compatibility.</p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-freeze">FREEZE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: freeze the display</i><br>
        <b>Freeze</b></p>

    <h3 class="command" id="i-unfreeze">UNFREEZE</h3>
    <p><i>instruction: unfreeze the display</i><br>
        <b>Unfreeze</b></p>

    <p>
        Use these commands in your AMOS Professional programs to perform
        a simple freezing and unfreezing of moving displays.</p>
